      Hello. I have a very simple and static website. Only pages. I want to integrate a small forum/community system in it. I know about StaticMan for comments, it is very easy to integrate and looks very easy to install even for newbies like me, but I am looking for a forum equilavent. Does anyone know of anything like that? Easily doable, can be hosted on even services like Heroku just like staticman, etc. This isn't a very crucial thing but I think it would be a fun experience. Thanks in advance.
    

      Setting up your own self-hosted cloud storage can be a cost-effective and private alternative to commercial cloud services. Here are some of the best solutions and tips from Redditors to help you get started:
    

Mini PCs: These are often recommended over Raspberry Pi for better performance and value. "Instead of RPi you should get a miniPC, you can get some with Intel N100 or N150 CPU and a 256/512GB SSD for less than $180."


Used SFF PCs: Buying a used Small Form Factor (SFF) PC can be a cheaper and more powerful option than a Raspberry Pi. "Get used SFF. It will be cheaper and powerful than Raspberry pie"


NAS Devices: For a more straightforward setup, consider a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. "Synology NAS. Currently has 27TB of total storage with about 14TB free."


Nextcloud: This is a popular choice for its comprehensive features and flexibility. "I prefer nextcloud. It is well maintained and flexible."


Seafile: Known for its performance and reliability, though it stores files in a proprietary format. "Seafile is probably more performant and reliable"


Syncthing: Ideal for simple file syncing between devices. "I use syncthing for simple file sync between devices."


Encryption: Use tools like Cryptomator to encrypt your data before storing it. "Downloaded cryptomator... Now all my data gets encrypted before touching the internet, on my device."


Backup Strategy: Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of your data, on two different types of media, with one copy off-site. "Always do 3-2-1 backup, regardless of how much you 'trust' your storage."


Remote Access: Use a VPN or Tailscale for secure remote access to your cloud storage. "Go with whatever hardware you want BUT DO NOT expose to the internet, have a VPN or tailscale to bridge that gap for you."

      Basically, that’s it. I have little to no experience with Kubernetes or cloud technologies. I wasn’t involved in any meaningful work with either of them in my previous roles. I’m currently unemployed and would love to gain some real, hands-on skills with both Kubernetes and AWS. Could you recommend any projects that would help me gain practical knowledge?

              For back-end programming discussion.
            

      Hey everyone,
    

      I’m currently in the middle of my 4th year of engineering and trying to decide which backend technology to focus on — Java Spring Boot or Python FastAPI. I’ve been doing mobile app development (Flutter) for quite some time, but since most startups use Flutter and the pay isn’t that great, I want to explore backend development for better opportunities.
    

      Here’s my situation and confusion 👇
    

      Java Spring Boot seems tougher to learn than Python FastAPI.
    

      However, most MNCs and enterprise companies use Spring Boot.
    

      With AI and ML booming, many modern companies are starting to adopt FastAPI because of Python’s ecosystem.
    

      I’ve already bought a paid Spring Boot course (worth ₹8,000) that covers backend from 0→1 (8 weeks) and 1→100 (9 weeks).
    

      I also found a free 12-hour FastAPI course on YouTube that looks great.
    

      My placement season is ongoing, so I don’t have unlimited time.
    

      I have strong frontend (Flutter) skills but very little backend experience.
    

      I feel getting placed in startups is easier, but the pay is lower compared to MNCs.
    

      The main reason I’m pausing Flutter is that it’s used mostly by startups and the compensation isn’t very attractive.
    

      Given all this, I’m really confused — 👉 Should I go with Java + Spring Boot (for better placement options and MNC exposure)? 👉 Or with Python + FastAPI (for faster learning and alignment with AI/startup ecosystem)?
    

      I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations or are working in backend roles — Which one should I choose and why, given my current context (final year + Flutter background + placements)?

      Hiya! I'm working on a compiled language right now, and I'm getting a bit stuck with the logical process of the parsing with expressions. I'm currently using the Shunting-Yard Algorithm to turn expressions into ASTs, but I'm struggling to figure out the rules for expressions.
    

      My 2 main issues are:
    

How do we define the end of an expression?


      It can parse, for example myVar = 2 * b + 431; perfectly fine, but when do we stop looking ahead? I find this issue particularly tricky when looking at brackets. It can also parse myVar = (120 * 2);, but it can't figure out myVar = (120 * 2) + 12;. I've tried using complex free grammar files to simplify the rules into a written form to help me understand, but I can never find any rule that fully helps escape this one.
    

      2. How do you differentiate between expressions in code?


      This might be worded oddly, but I can't find a good rule for "The expression ends here". The best solution I can think of is getting the bracket depth and checking for a seperator token when the bracket depth is 0, but it just seems finicky and I'm not sure if it's correct. I'm currently just splitting them at every comma for now, but that obviously has the issue of... functions. (e.g. max(1, 10))
    

      Also, just as a bonus ask - how, in total, would I go about inbuilt functions? Logically I feel like it would be a bit odd for each individual one to be hard coded in, like checking for each function, but it very well could be. I just want to see if there's any more "optimised" way.

      Hi, I have been working as a GPU Compiler Engineer for around 1.5 years and planning to switch to ML Compiler Engineer. At my current position, I like working and debugging LLVM Optimizations but I don't like the part of learning more and more about GPU hardware and memory related concepts. I heard ML Compiler Engineer will need to work on Algorithms heavy code which sounds interesting. Any suggestions on which role I should choose for a better career in terms of pay and stability.
    

      GPU Compiler Engineer roles are limited to HW Companies but ML Compiler Engineer roles can be found in both HW and SW Companies.

      Hi fellow compilers -- I am finishing up my grad school and have an interview opportunity at Waymo for ML compiler role. I have taken compiler courses and integrated an optimization pass in the LLVM framework. I am very interested in this opportunity and want to prepare well for it. Could you guys give me some suggestions/advice on how to prepare for it? Would also love to hear from people who have gone through these rounds at Waymo. Thanks!

      I’m developing a software system that takes a high-level description of hardware components—such as a queuing buffer with defined input/output ports and a finite state machine (FSM) describing its behavior—and automatically generates corresponding high-level language implementations (for example, C++ code). I’m looking for recommendations on existing tools, frameworks, or techniques that could help achieve this.

      I've built a Python tool that performs deep semantic analysis to detect inconsistencies that traditional linters and statistical AI models miss. It solves the problem of logical errors arising when a function's stated purpose doesn't match its actual implementation.
    

      What this means: This tool can find semantic bugs—the kind of logical contradictions that often lead to production errors and technical debt.
    

      The Python Code Harmonizer is a standalone application designed to enforce semantic consistency across your entire codebase.
    

      What it provides: The tool analyzes your Python functions and generates a Semantic Disharmony Score—a quantifiable metric that measures the logical distance between a promise and its fulfillment.
    

Parses Syntax: It uses the Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to extract function names, documentation, and the complete implementation logic.
    

Maps Semantics: It maps both the Intent (from the name/docstring) and the Execution (from the code body) into a fixed, multi-dimensional Conceptual Space.
    

Measures Disharmony: It calculates the Euclidean distance between the Intent Coordinate and the Execution Coordinate. A score closer to 0 is "Harmonious"; a high score is a critical semantic bug.
    

Generates Report: It produces a clear CLI report showing which functions have the largest Intent-Execution Gaps, ranked by severity.
    

Example findings:


      A function named calculate_score() that uses db.fetch_cache() (Intent: Wisdom vs. Execution: Justice/Power).
    

      A function named validate_input() that contains os.remove() calls (Intent: Justice vs. Execution: Power/Force).
    

      A get_data() method that uses highly destructive write/delete patterns.
    

      This tool operates on a Semantic Metric that no current commercial or open-source solution uses.
    

      This project provides an objective metric for problems that are currently subjective ("This function feels wrong").
    

      If you are dealing with large, complex Python codebases or are interested in a deterministic, quantifiable approach to code meaning, I’d appreciate a look and any feedback on the underlying approach!
    

🔗 Repo: https://github.com/BruinGrowly/Python-Code-Harmonizer 📦 Minimal Dependencies: Pure Python (ast, math, dataclasses, re). 🛠️ Extensible: The semantic engine is designed to be easily extended with new keywords and rules.

              Subreddit to discuss ChatGPT and AI. Not affiliated with OpenAI. Thanks, Nat!
            

      I’m running Llama3 LLM locally on my laptop with no network access.  I set constraints in his environment to a 4 core CPU and only 4GB memory.  He will continue generating tokens until memory exhaustion and he will crash, die, respawn, and repeat.  I almost feel sorry for him
    

      I’m planning to get this running on a Raspberry Pi5 with a HUB75 RGB matrix displaying ‘his thoughts’ and get it running stand alone with no external network access.
    

      This was inspired by an art installation called ‘Latent Reflection’ by RootKid, and I wanted to make something like that myself to see if I can even pull this off with no coding experience.
    

      …and because this is a learning experience for me, I’m enlisting the assistance of ChatGPT to help me with this lol
    

      ChatGPT has become a versatile tool that many Redditors use in creative and practical ways daily. Here are some of the most interesting and useful applications they've shared:

Fanfiction and Roleplay: ChatGPT is often used to generate fanfiction and assist in roleplay scenarios. "I ask it to write fanfiction for me, and it's great."


Philosophical Debates: Some users engage ChatGPT in philosophical discussions to explore different viewpoints. "philosophical debates"


Generating Coloring Books: ChatGPT can turn favorite family photos into coloring book pages. "Turn my toddler's favorite family photos into coloring books we print out"


Meal Planning: ChatGPT can create meal plans based on ingredients available in the fridge. "To make a meal out of ingredients I have in the fridge"


Work Optimization: ChatGPT can act as a workflow optimizer, suggesting automation ideas for various tasks. "Act as a workflow optimizer…"


Email Assistance: It can help craft polite and professional emails. "Rewrite this email in 3 tones: professional, friendly, and persuasive."


Document Summarization: ChatGPT can condense long documents into concise summaries. "Turn this 5-page doc into a 1-slide summary."


Coding Help: It can explain and fix code, making debugging easier. "Explain this code like I’m 5 — then fix it."


Asking "Dumb Questions": ChatGPT provides a safe space to ask questions without judgment. "I ask 'dumb questions.'"


Learning and Language Practice: It can act as a language practice partner, offering instant feedback and corrections. "It's a great partner to practice a language with"


Mental Health Support: ChatGPT can help in navigating personal challenges, such as abusive relationships, by providing structured plans and resources. "I asked it to help me create a framework to get out of an abusive relationship with a narcissist."


Generating Rituals and Spells: Some users create fun and quirky rituals or spells to brighten their day. "I convinced him I'm a witch so now he creates little rituals and spells for me."

              A wholesome community made by & for software & tech folks in India.
Have a doubt? Ask it out.
            

      Hey folks, I really need some honest advice and suggestions from people in the tech/startup ecosystem.
    

      I’m a non-technical founder building a health and wellness app — something I’ve been deeply passionate about for a long time. After months of trying to find the right people, I finally met someone from Kerala who said he had a similar vision and promised to help me execute it. He told me he’d handle team hiring, technical planning, and project management.
    

      He even prepared a phase-wise technical document and roadmap, which looked really promising. I’m based in Navi Mumbai, but I decided to move to Kerala to be closer to the team and lead from the front.
    

      However, things started going downhill fast. During the first month, I couldn’t be there due to personal issues and arranging funds (which, by the way, are from my own savings). From the second month onwards, I’ve been in Kerala full-time, and it’s been really disappointing.
    

      The team isn’t following the roadmap. They’re not delivering results, and every time I raise a concern, the guy who promised to help me defends the developers instead of addressing the issue. His usual line is: “Software doesn’t work like that, you won’t see results immediately.” But it’s been long enough, and I can clearly see things aren’t moving.
    

      Then there’s my UI/UX guy — honestly, I don’t even know what he’s doing. I’m paying him ₹30k/month plus ₹5k for his office space. I’ve spent ₹1,05,000 already, and the Figma file looks nowhere near what I envisioned. He doesn’t listen to feedback, ignores the vision completely, and just recycles the same screens. When I ask for progress updates, he merges multiple weekly tasks into one and takes 4–6 days for things that should take hours.
    

      It’s draining. I’ve lost mental peace completely. From the moment I wake up until I go to bed, I’m anxious about the project, the team, and my finances.
    

      The person who initially said he’d “help me build this together” now comes to the office at 4 PM, spends time on his phone/laptop, and when I try to talk about the project, he says he’s “too busy with other projects.”
    

      I feel stuck and helpless. I’m burning through my savings, getting no real output, and losing confidence.
    

      Can anyone from the startup or tech industry help me assess what’s going wrong?
    

      How can I evaluate my UI/UX guy’s work?
    

      What’s the best way to audit the project’s progress technically when you’re non-technical?
    

      Should I cut my losses and rebuild from scratch with a new team, or try to fix this mess?
    

      Any honest feedback, guidance, or even mentorship would mean a lot right now. Thank you so much for reading this. 🙏

      Curious if anyone has done any LeetCode style interviews recently?
    

      Recently interviewed for a Senior DevOps role at a FAANG adjacent company which was a 6 stage process.
    

      I thought I was doing pretty well after going though multiple stages doing system design, architecture, reliability engineering, scenario based troubleshooting etc, and even got through some coding exercises in Python.
    

      One of the interviewers was changed last minute. I was told it would purely be a cultural fit type of interview but it ended up being a couple of LeetCode style problems which completely threw me off and I kinda of bombed and struggled to get through them.
    

      I'm fairly experienced with Python but never learned DSA as I don't have a software engineering background and was frustrated to get failed on this after everything.

              A place to share, discuss, discover, assist with, gain assistance for, and critique self-hosted alternatives to our favorite web apps, web services, and online tools.
            

      Hello. I have a very simple and static website. Only pages. I want to integrate a small forum/community system in it. I know about StaticMan for comments, it is very easy to integrate and looks very easy to install even for newbies like me, but I am looking for a forum equilavent. Does anyone know of anything like that? Easily doable, can be hosted on even services like Heroku just like staticman, etc. This isn't a very crucial thing but I think it would be a fun experience. Thanks in advance.
    

      Setting up your own self-hosted cloud storage can be a cost-effective and private alternative to commercial cloud services. Here are some of the best solutions and tips from Redditors to help you get started:
    

Mini PCs: These are often recommended over Raspberry Pi for better performance and value. "Instead of RPi you should get a miniPC, you can get some with Intel N100 or N150 CPU and a 256/512GB SSD for less than $180."


Used SFF PCs: Buying a used Small Form Factor (SFF) PC can be a cheaper and more powerful option than a Raspberry Pi. "Get used SFF. It will be cheaper and powerful than Raspberry pie"


NAS Devices: For a more straightforward setup, consider a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. "Synology NAS. Currently has 27TB of total storage with about 14TB free."


Nextcloud: This is a popular choice for its comprehensive features and flexibility. "I prefer nextcloud. It is well maintained and flexible."


Seafile: Known for its performance and reliability, though it stores files in a proprietary format. "Seafile is probably more performant and reliable"


Syncthing: Ideal for simple file syncing between devices. "I use syncthing for simple file sync between devices."


Encryption: Use tools like Cryptomator to encrypt your data before storing it. "Downloaded cryptomator... Now all my data gets encrypted before touching the internet, on my device."


Backup Strategy: Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of your data, on two different types of media, with one copy off-site. "Always do 3-2-1 backup, regardless of how much you 'trust' your storage."


Remote Access: Use a VPN or Tailscale for secure remote access to your cloud storage. "Go with whatever hardware you want BUT DO NOT expose to the internet, have a VPN or tailscale to bridge that gap for you."

      Basically, that’s it. I have little to no experience with Kubernetes or cloud technologies. I wasn’t involved in any meaningful work with either of them in my previous roles. I’m currently unemployed and would love to gain some real, hands-on skills with both Kubernetes and AWS. Could you recommend any projects that would help me gain practical knowledge?

      Hey everyone,
    

      I’m currently in the middle of my 4th year of engineering and trying to decide which backend technology to focus on — Java Spring Boot or Python FastAPI. I’ve been doing mobile app development (Flutter) for quite some time, but since most startups use Flutter and the pay isn’t that great, I want to explore backend development for better opportunities.
    

      Here’s my situation and confusion 👇
    

      Java Spring Boot seems tougher to learn than Python FastAPI.
    

      However, most MNCs and enterprise companies use Spring Boot.
    

      With AI and ML booming, many modern companies are starting to adopt FastAPI because of Python’s ecosystem.
    

      I’ve already bought a paid Spring Boot course (worth ₹8,000) that covers backend from 0→1 (8 weeks) and 1→100 (9 weeks).
    

      I also found a free 12-hour FastAPI course on YouTube that looks great.
    

      My placement season is ongoing, so I don’t have unlimited time.
    

      I have strong frontend (Flutter) skills but very little backend experience.
    

      I feel getting placed in startups is easier, but the pay is lower compared to MNCs.
    

      The main reason I’m pausing Flutter is that it’s used mostly by startups and the compensation isn’t very attractive.
    

      Given all this, I’m really confused — 👉 Should I go with Java + Spring Boot (for better placement options and MNC exposure)? 👉 Or with Python + FastAPI (for faster learning and alignment with AI/startup ecosystem)?
    

      I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations or are working in backend roles — Which one should I choose and why, given my current context (final year + Flutter background + placements)?

              Ask questions and post articles about the Go programming language and related tools, events etc.
            

      I can find a list of "awesome go", but most of them are libraries, and partly are they outdated/unmaintained. Is there also a list of "awesome go applications"? If not, what do you consider the most interesting ones?

      Hiya! I'm working on a compiled language right now, and I'm getting a bit stuck with the logical process of the parsing with expressions. I'm currently using the Shunting-Yard Algorithm to turn expressions into ASTs, but I'm struggling to figure out the rules for expressions.
    

      My 2 main issues are:
    

How do we define the end of an expression?


      It can parse, for example myVar = 2 * b + 431; perfectly fine, but when do we stop looking ahead? I find this issue particularly tricky when looking at brackets. It can also parse myVar = (120 * 2);, but it can't figure out myVar = (120 * 2) + 12;. I've tried using complex free grammar files to simplify the rules into a written form to help me understand, but I can never find any rule that fully helps escape this one.
    

      2. How do you differentiate between expressions in code?


      This might be worded oddly, but I can't find a good rule for "The expression ends here". The best solution I can think of is getting the bracket depth and checking for a seperator token when the bracket depth is 0, but it just seems finicky and I'm not sure if it's correct. I'm currently just splitting them at every comma for now, but that obviously has the issue of... functions. (e.g. max(1, 10))
    

      Also, just as a bonus ask - how, in total, would I go about inbuilt functions? Logically I feel like it would be a bit odd for each individual one to be hard coded in, like checking for each function, but it very well could be. I just want to see if there's any more "optimised" way.

      Hi, I have been working as a GPU Compiler Engineer for around 1.5 years and planning to switch to ML Compiler Engineer. At my current position, I like working and debugging LLVM Optimizations but I don't like the part of learning more and more about GPU hardware and memory related concepts. I heard ML Compiler Engineer will need to work on Algorithms heavy code which sounds interesting. Any suggestions on which role I should choose for a better career in terms of pay and stability.
    

      GPU Compiler Engineer roles are limited to HW Companies but ML Compiler Engineer roles can be found in both HW and SW Companies.

      Hi fellow compilers -- I am finishing up my grad school and have an interview opportunity at Waymo for ML compiler role. I have taken compiler courses and integrated an optimization pass in the LLVM framework. I am very interested in this opportunity and want to prepare well for it. Could you guys give me some suggestions/advice on how to prepare for it? Would also love to hear from people who have gone through these rounds at Waymo. Thanks!
    

      Just-in-time (JIT) compilation is a technique used by virtual machines to improve the performance of programs. Here's a succinct guide on how it works, based on insights from Redditors:
    

Traditional Compilation: Source code is compiled into machine code before execution. "Traditional compilers take your human-readable source code & compile it to machine code."


Interpretation: Source code is executed line by line without prior compilation. "Traditional interpreters take your human-readable source code & figure out what it does for every step."


Virtual Machines (VMs): Many modern languages use VMs to run bytecode, which is an intermediate representation of the code. "Most of them have moved to 'virtual machines' which are a more abstract set of machine-readable instructions but aren't directly executable on the CPU."


JIT Process: The JIT compiler translates bytecode into native machine code while the program is running. "A JIT compiler in a virtual machine takes those VM instructions and, while the program is running, converts them directly into a machine code."


Runtime Optimization: JIT compilers can optimize code based on runtime information. "JIT is often faster because it compiles the code when it is actually called for, the first time it is called."


Dynamic Optimization: They can recompile critical paths to be optimized for specific use cases. "So sometimes this can happen because the JIT can track what is happening at runtime, and recompile critical paths to be optimized for that use."


Cross-Platform Compatibility: JIT allows bytecode to run on different platforms. "A JIT allows you to run an arbitrary byte-code instead of compiling directly to machine code, which allows more portability across different platforms."


Easier Development: It simplifies the development process by providing a consistent execution environment. "It also allows for some things to be done easier then in an AOT compiler."


Widespread Use: JIT compilation is a staple in Java and .NET environments. "Most Java implementations (as well as .NET) have been using JIT for a while."


Performance Boost: JIT in Android Nougat significantly improved performance. "Getting a JITter in there will probably result in a 2x or better performance boost."


Browser Performance: JIT is crucial for high-performance JavaScript engines in browsers like Chrome. "A large part of its performance came from using JIT in its Javascript engine."


Performance Variability: JIT can be faster in some dynamic scenarios, but AOT often excels in raw performance. "In practice, I've never seen any non-trivial code which runs faster when JITed instead of being pre-compiled."


Flexibility vs. Speed: JIT offers more flexibility and portability at the cost of initial startup time. "The real reason that JIT is used is because it's more flexible and portable without being too slow (as an interpreter is)."

      I’m developing a software system that takes a high-level description of hardware components—such as a queuing buffer with defined input/output ports and a finite state machine (FSM) describing its behavior—and automatically generates corresponding high-level language implementations (for example, C++ code). I’m looking for recommendations on existing tools, frameworks, or techniques that could help achieve this.

      I'm an academic researcher tackling a huge security problem: basic image CAPTCHAs (the traffic light/crosswalk hell) are now easily cracked by advanced AI like GPT-4's vision models. Our current human verification system is failing.
    

      I urgently need your help designing the next generation of AI-proof defenses. I built a quick, 2-minute anonymous survey to measure one key thing:
    

What's the maximum frustration a human will tolerate for guaranteed, AI-proof security?


      Your data is critical. We don't collect emails or IPs. I'm just a fellow human trying to make the internet less vulnerable. 🙏

      I've built a Python tool that performs deep semantic analysis to detect inconsistencies that traditional linters and statistical AI models miss. It solves the problem of logical errors arising when a function's stated purpose doesn't match its actual implementation.
    

      What this means: This tool can find semantic bugs—the kind of logical contradictions that often lead to production errors and technical debt.
    

      The Python Code Harmonizer is a standalone application designed to enforce semantic consistency across your entire codebase.
    

      What it provides: The tool analyzes your Python functions and generates a Semantic Disharmony Score—a quantifiable metric that measures the logical distance between a promise and its fulfillment.
    

Parses Syntax: It uses the Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to extract function names, documentation, and the complete implementation logic.
    

Maps Semantics: It maps both the Intent (from the name/docstring) and the Execution (from the code body) into a fixed, multi-dimensional Conceptual Space.
    

Measures Disharmony: It calculates the Euclidean distance between the Intent Coordinate and the Execution Coordinate. A score closer to 0 is "Harmonious"; a high score is a critical semantic bug.
    

Generates Report: It produces a clear CLI report showing which functions have the largest Intent-Execution Gaps, ranked by severity.
    

Example findings:


      A function named calculate_score() that uses db.fetch_cache() (Intent: Wisdom vs. Execution: Justice/Power).
    

      A function named validate_input() that contains os.remove() calls (Intent: Justice vs. Execution: Power/Force).
    

      A get_data() method that uses highly destructive write/delete patterns.
    

      This tool operates on a Semantic Metric that no current commercial or open-source solution uses.
    

      This project provides an objective metric for problems that are currently subjective ("This function feels wrong").
    

      If you are dealing with large, complex Python codebases or are interested in a deterministic, quantifiable approach to code meaning, I’d appreciate a look and any feedback on the underlying approach!

              Subreddit to discuss ChatGPT and AI. Not affiliated with OpenAI. Thanks, Nat!
            

      I’m running Llama3 LLM locally on my laptop with no network access.  I set constraints in his environment to a 4 core CPU and only 4GB memory.  He will continue generating tokens until memory exhaustion and he will crash, die, respawn, and repeat.  I almost feel sorry for him
    

      I’m planning to get this running on a Raspberry Pi5 with a HUB75 RGB matrix displaying ‘his thoughts’ and get it running stand alone with no external network access.
    

      This was inspired by an art installation called ‘Latent Reflection’ by RootKid, and I wanted to make something like that myself to see if I can even pull this off with no coding experience.
    

      …and because this is a learning experience for me, I’m enlisting the assistance of ChatGPT to help me with this lol
    

      ChatGPT has become a versatile tool that many Redditors use in creative and practical ways daily. Here are some of the most interesting and useful applications they've shared:
    

Storytelling and Creative Writing: Many users, including myself, use ChatGPT to help with creative writing, character development, and overcoming writer's block. "I give it a cast of characters, a setting, some plot. I write out scenes like a director, then it fleshes them out."


Fanfiction and Roleplay: ChatGPT is often used to generate fanfiction and assist in roleplay scenarios. "I ask it to write fanfiction for me, and it's great."


Philosophical Debates: Some users engage ChatGPT in philosophical discussions to explore different viewpoints. "philosophical debates"


Generating Coloring Books: ChatGPT can turn favorite family photos into coloring book pages. "Turn my toddler's favorite family photos into coloring books we print out"


Meal Planning: ChatGPT can create meal plans based on ingredients available in the fridge. "To make a meal out of ingredients I have in the fridge"


Work Optimization: ChatGPT can act as a workflow optimizer, suggesting automation ideas for various tasks. "Act as a workflow optimizer…"


Email Assistance: It can help craft polite and professional emails. "Rewrite this email in 3 tones: professional, friendly, and persuasive."


Document Summarization: ChatGPT can condense long documents into concise summaries. "Turn this 5-page doc into a 1-slide summary."


Coding Help: It can explain and fix code, making debugging easier. "Explain this code like I’m 5 — then fix it."


Asking "Dumb Questions": ChatGPT provides a safe space to ask questions without judgment. "I ask 'dumb questions.'"


Learning and Language Practice: It can act as a language practice partner, offering instant feedback and corrections. "It's a great partner to practice a language with"


Mental Health Support: ChatGPT can help in navigating personal challenges, such as abusive relationships, by providing structured plans and resources. "I asked it to help me create a framework to get out of an abusive relationship with a narcissist."


Generating Rituals and Spells: Some users create fun and quirky rituals or spells to brighten their day. "I convinced him I'm a witch so now he creates little rituals and spells for me."


Creating Character Sheets: It can help in detailing character descriptions for creative projects. "It helped flesh out character reference sheets (the written stuff)"

              A wholesome community made by & for software & tech folks in India.
Have a doubt? Ask it out.
            

      Hey folks, I really need some honest advice and suggestions from people in the tech/startup ecosystem.
    

      I’m a non-technical founder building a health and wellness app — something I’ve been deeply passionate about for a long time. After months of trying to find the right people, I finally met someone from Kerala who said he had a similar vision and promised to help me execute it. He told me he’d handle team hiring, technical planning, and project management.
    

      He even prepared a phase-wise technical document and roadmap, which looked really promising. I’m based in Navi Mumbai, but I decided to move to Kerala to be closer to the team and lead from the front.
    

      However, things started going downhill fast. During the first month, I couldn’t be there due to personal issues and arranging funds (which, by the way, are from my own savings). From the second month onwards, I’ve been in Kerala full-time, and it’s been really disappointing.
    

      The team isn’t following the roadmap. They’re not delivering results, and every time I raise a concern, the guy who promised to help me defends the developers instead of addressing the issue. His usual line is: “Software doesn’t work like that, you won’t see results immediately.” But it’s been long enough, and I can clearly see things aren’t moving.
    

      Then there’s my UI/UX guy — honestly, I don’t even know what he’s doing. I’m paying him ₹30k/month plus ₹5k for his office space. I’ve spent ₹1,05,000 already, and the Figma file looks nowhere near what I envisioned. He doesn’t listen to feedback, ignores the vision completely, and just recycles the same screens. When I ask for progress updates, he merges multiple weekly tasks into one and takes 4–6 days for things that should take hours.
    

      It’s draining. I’ve lost mental peace completely. From the moment I wake up until I go to bed, I’m anxious about the project, the team, and my finances.
    

      The person who initially said he’d “help me build this together” now comes to the office at 4 PM, spends time on his phone/laptop, and when I try to talk about the project, he says he’s “too busy with other projects.”
    

      I feel stuck and helpless. I’m burning through my savings, getting no real output, and losing confidence.
    

      Can anyone from the startup or tech industry help me assess what’s going wrong?
    

      How can I evaluate my UI/UX guy’s work?
    

      What’s the best way to audit the project’s progress technically when you’re non-technical?
    

      Should I cut my losses and rebuild from scratch with a new team, or try to fix this mess?
    

      Any honest feedback, guidance, or even mentorship would mean a lot right now. Thank you so much for reading this. 🙏

      Curious if anyone has done any LeetCode style interviews recently?
    

      Recently interviewed for a Senior DevOps role at a FAANG adjacent company which was a 6 stage process.
    

      I thought I was doing pretty well after going though multiple stages doing system design, architecture, reliability engineering, scenario based troubleshooting etc, and even got through some coding exercises in Python.
    

      One of the interviewers was changed last minute. I was told it would purely be a cultural fit type of interview but it ended up being a couple of LeetCode style problems which completely threw me off and I kinda of bombed and struggled to get through them.
    

      I'm fairly experienced with Python but never learned DSA as I don't have a software engineering background and was frustrated to get failed on this after everything.

      Might be a bit off-topic, but I’m curious.
    

      I’m a computer science student, and I’m looking for a new way to stay on top of all things tech. Do any of you listen to tech podcasts, and if so, do you have any suggestions?
    


      What's the difference? My understanding is that greedy property means a globally optimal solution can be obtained by making locally optimum decisions and optimal substructure is that building an optimum solution can be done by by finding solutions to optimum subproblems. Idk if I'm explaining it right but it sounds like the same thing basically.

      This subreddit is dedicated to the academics of the field of Computer Science. Here, we discuss CS research and theory, as well as theory behind software engineering/programming (e.g. language design).
    

      A good discussion requires some back and forth and disagreements will be common. We should be civil about our disagreements and always "remember the person".
    

      There are already subreddits dedicated to career or major advice, such as r/cscareerquestions, r/csMajors and r/careerguidance. If you have a problem which classes/curses to take, what topics to review, which major to choose, what career path to pursue, what certifications to get etc. then ask on better suited subreddit. This subreddit is dedicated to the discussion about academics of Computer Science, not the career focused aspects of CS.
    

      This is not a place to advertise your product nor yourself. However, new innovations should not be disregarded and can be submitted in the form of an IAmA.
    

      We all like a good laugh, but this should not be a place that is being swarmed by memes and joke submissions. Try sticking to content that is related to Computer Science and spikes your interest and even might create fun discussions.
    

      Reddit already has a wide range of subreddits which will help you with acquiring a new personal device (e.g. r/SuggestALaptop, r/PickAnAndroidForMe, r/buildapc). However, out of the scope of personal devices, we feel that r/computerscience can be a place where you can discuss purchase advice for purposes like HPC, Machine Learning etc. In short, we try to avoid hundreds of posts of college students looking for a new personal device.
    

r/computerscience is not r/techsupport, r/learnprogramming, r/programminghelp, r/CodingHelp nor your personal StackOverflow. If you want to learn programming, need help with particular language or have some computer issue, go to those subreddits or to one directly involved with the topic.
    

      Even though we like to help you out, this is not the place to solve such questions. There are ethical considerations such as how much help to give and what is the right kind of help. Posting about a generalized problem can result in a broader discussion, rather than people that are just solving your problem.
    

      Don't ask for project/research/app/... ideas. There already is abundant amount of such post from the past and a lot of blog posts over the Internet as well. Please, either use the search engine or ask on more appropriate subreddit.
    

      While we encourage community members sharing their own research, all research must comply with the following:
    

      For major scientific discoveries, such as P=NP, it must include a link to a peer-reviewed paper.
    

      Research generated by a language model, e.g. ChatGPT, will not be accepted.
    

      Posts generated by language models, commonly referred to as "AI", will be removed.
    
      Hey r/compsci, I just finished writing a post about a 1988 paper that completely blew my mind, and I wanted to share the idea and get your take on it.
    

      Most of crypto relies on computational assumptions: things we hope are hard, like "factoring is tough" or "you can't invert a one-way function."
    

      But back in 1988, Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian, and Wigderson (BGKW) tossed all that out. They didn't replace computational hardness with another computational assumption; they replaced it with a physical one: isolation.
    

      Instead of assuming an attacker can't compute something, you just assume two cooperating provers can't talk to each other during the proof. They showed that isolation itself can be seen as a cryptographic primitive.
    

      That one shift is huge:
    

Unconditional Security: You get information-theoretic guarantees with literally no hardness assumptions needed. Security is a fact, not a hope.
    

Massive Complexity Impact: It introduced Multi-Prover Interactive Proofs (MIP), which led to the landmark results MIP = NEXP and later the crazy MIP* = RE in quantum complexity.
    

Foundational Shift: It changed how we build primitives like zero-knowledge proofs and bit commitments, making them possible without complexity assumptions.
    

      My question for the community: Do you feel this kind of "physical assumption" (like verifiable isolation or no communication) still has huge, untapped potential in modern crypto? Or has the concept been fully exploited by the multiprover setting and newer models like device-independent crypto ? Do you know any other field in which this idea of physical seperation manage to offer a new lens on problems.
    

      I'm pretty new to posting here, so if this isn't a great fit for the sub, please let me know, happy to adjust next time! Also, feedback on the post itself is very welcome, I’d love to make future write-ups clearer and more useful.

      Amazon is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning Tuesday, as the company works to pare expenses and compensate for overhiring during the peak demand of the pandemic, according to three people familiar with the matter.
    

      The figure represents a small percentage of Amazon’s 1.55 million total employees, but nearly 10% of the company’s roughly 350,000 corporate employees. This would represent the largest job cut at Amazon since around 27,000 jobs were eliminated starting in late 2022.
    

      Managers of impacted teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning

      What are your thoughts on this?
    

      This field is done. I’ve applied to over 750 jobs in the last four months and Im still unemployed.  Custom resumes, cover letters, reaching out to the hiring team on LinkedIn and still nothing. I have a BS in CS, two YOE , certs and projects.
    

      I decided I’d apply to 1k jobs before I gave up but I might just stop now. Just made it to the final round for my second company and again I got rejected. Im just tired.
    

      Anyone that’s considering this field, don’t. Unless you have connections and can get in through that or Nepotism don’t bother with this field. I feel like I wasted the last 6 years of my life and all my work, money and time has been for nothing. Fuck the people in charge for destroying this field and giving our jobs away overseas.

      As a recent graduate with an IT degree, I was wondering how I could get into tech sales? Is there an established pathway or is it more knowing the right people and being in the right places?

      YOE: 5 + Masters in CS from US
    

      Current Role: SDE-2 at Rainforest (1 year into the role, 3.5 at the company)
    

      Location: Toronto
    

      Situation: My manager changed recently and he seems to have god knows what grudge with me. Doesn’t treat me with respect, micromanages, and tries to twist and turn facts against me. With the layoffs and constant mental “pressure” at work, I am done with my current job and seeking a new and challenging role.
    

      About me: Not a leetcode monkey at all but can code decently. I work hard and love solving problems (all kinds). I want a job I can be happy at while getting paid. A job where I can look forward to go to work to.
    

      What roles and companies should I look at next? I don’t mind changing my role if the work is challenging and I can see myself doing it happily with a similar range pay (willing to take a small cut/similar range if it’s the right role).
    

      I am looking at SDM/ Senior Software Engineer/Product Manager roles but I am only getting calls for Senior Software Engineer/SDE-2 roles. Is there a way to externally break into any of these other roles? Willing to put in effort
    

      hey everyone,
    

      i’ve been working on two free open-source github repos that keep track of cs internships and new grad/junior roles in canada, its kinda like the ones simplify maintains, but focused entirely on canada.
    

      i update them daily from multiple sources to keep everything current. goal’s just to make job searching a bit easier for students and grads here.
    

      new grad repo: https://github.com/hanzili/canada_sde_junior_new_grad_positionintern repo: https://github.com/hanzili/canada_sde_intern_position


      feedback or contributions are always welcome :)
    

(just sharing a free community resource, not self-promo :3


      Hey folks, looking for advice comparing two offers:
    

Offer #1 — Trend Micro (Ottawa)


      Role: Senior Software Developer


$120,000 CAD base


      Hybrid: min 3 days/week in office (Kanata/Ottawa)
    

      Strong benefits (health/dental/vision, disability, etc.) + RPP match up to 5%


      Discretionary company bonus (no % stated)
    

      I can live rent-free in Ottawa
    

Offer #2 — Clutch (Toronto)


      Role: Senior Software Engineer


$160,000 CAD base


1,500 stock options (grant recommended within 3 months; board approval; 3-year vest)
    

      Letter doesn’t specify onsite frequency; team described the role as hybrid


      Would need to pay Toronto rent (1-bedroom estimates I’m seeing: ~$2.4–$2.8k/mo)
    

Quick money math (very rough)


      Ottawa $120k: take-home ≈ $6.8k/mo after tax; $0 rent ⇒ $6.8k/mo left


      Toronto $160k: take-home ≈ $8.5k/mo; minus $2.6k rent ⇒ $5.9k/mo left


      Net, I’d likely save ~+$900/mo more in Ottawa (rent-free), but Clutch has equity upside.
    

What I’m asking the sub


      Would you take the higher base + options in Toronto (with rent), or the lower base but better net savings + benefits in Ottawa?
    

      If you’ve worked at Trend Micro Ottawa or Clutch Toronto, how were career growth and work-life balance?
    

      For hybrid roles: how realistic is negotiating more remote? Maybe for less pay?
    

      Thanks in advance! Happy to clarify anything I can without doxxing myself 🙏

      Hello everyone,
    

      I finally got a job after about a year and a half of applying. I applied a lot (1600+ job apps) and interviewed a lot (20+ interviews). I only landed one of them. Here is some of my advice so that everyone on this sub can do better at landing their first role.
    

      First off, to everyone who's on this sub and other cs subs who spends time looking at posts like CS IS DYING!!!, please stop. Okay I know the CS market isn't doing that well right now. Offshoring, A.I., and overhiring during the pandemic are all making it harder for new grads. Reddit makes it look like CS is dead. If you look at data, however, you'll see a very different picture. According to this article, the unemployment rate for CS is 6.1%: https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/college-majors-with-the-lowest-unemployment-rates-report/491781 . That is actually bad for CS right now compared to the past, but obviously not so bad that no one is getting jobs. Among my university friends, the vast majority them are now employed (will admit I'm from a top 10 CS program). Looking at CS subs, you just see two extremes people doing really well or people thinking the field is dying or already dead (but instead of doing something about it like switching fields they just complain on Reddit). Don't use Reddit to guage where the field is at. Use your own research. I never believed the field was doing as bad as what people on Reddit were saying. If you do your own research and find out that the field is screwed, then switch out. Do something about it. Don't waste time on Reddit stressing about it, do something. Since I wasn't convinced the field was dead, I should've been spending my time applying or doing leetcode or doing projects. And yeah I didn't daily waste a huge amount of time doom scrolling on Reddit or social media in general, but I should not have spent any time on it. I should've done something about it, instead of stressing myself out and wasting my time. And I know there are people on this sub in the same boat as I was, so just get out of it.
    

      Second be careful where you apply. Getting referrals is important, but for me it didn't really help. I messaged people on Linkedin and got referrals, but I don't think I ever got an interview except from one company (Visa) from a referral. Still, I think referrals are useful. I just want to be truthful of my experience. I would also say as a new grad your experience is just not that significant compared to what many entry-level/associate roles are expecting. People think it's a great idea to apply for startups, but in my experience, they really want someone who's experienced. I mean it makes sense they don't have the money or the time to train an employee compared to an established company. Your experience with projects and coursework is just not going to cut it in most cases. You'd need to do a lot of work outside your courses to realistically make it into a startup from my experience. I actually interviewed at two different startups, and I do not know why they expected me to basically have 3+ years of experience with whatever tech stack they're working with as a new grad. They never outright said that to me, but when I was interviewing I got grilled on questions that clearly require industry-experience to answer, and a good amount of experience at that. I mean I don't know why they are wasting my time and their time, but that's just how hiring works. It's messy especially for small companies. Almost everyone I know is currently working at a big company not necessarily a big tech comapny, but definetly a large company that has the capital and time to train a new grad. It's honestly much easier. Similarly, there are large companies that want you to have experience in a particular technology. Don't bother applying for it unless you really know that technology inside out. You're just wasting your time otherwise. I know it's dumb. Sometimes they even say new grad in the role and they have this expectation, but again that's just how hiring works. It's messy. If you don't know a tech stack and they want you to be experienced in it, don't think that they'll hire you because you're trainable. You may be trainable, but most companies will never pick you over someone who has experience with the technology for the role.
    

      And lastly don't stress about all this. Go hang out with your friends. Make time for your hobbies. Not getting a job is really serious. I mean what's the alternative to that being homeless, but it's going to work out. Even if you don't land a job in CS, you'll land it somewhere else. If you're in America, you'll still live a life most people everywhere else in the world dream about. You need time for yourself. Do some stuff that isn't stressful. All the stress I had during this application cycle was just not helpful. I could've done better honestly if I just let myself be less stressed out. Look if stressing can get you a job, then I would've become the CEO of Nvidia by now. It doesn't do much other than hurt you. So please don't stress.
    

      That's all good luck to everyone who's still job hunting.

 Full details & how‑to ➜ 
      I graduated in Computer Engineering. I’ve never been obsessed with coding, but I sometimes enjoyed it — especially frontend. Later, I decided to try being a Business Analyst. I moved to another city and quickly found a job, but things changed after I started.
    

      The company is small — only 22 people, 3 of us are analysts. My supervisor studied logistics, not engineering, so the tasks I get aren’t related to software at all. Most of the time, I talk to customers about delivery dates or requirements. I do some basic SQL updates, but I don’t really solve any problems, technically or operationally.
    

      Now I’m wondering — should I go back to development, or try to become a Data Analyst? Is it possible for someone who started as a Business Analyst to switch to development later? Or is it too late for me?
    

      I’m 25 and still not sure what kind of career I really want. Data analysis sounds interesting, though. What do you think?
    


      Hi all — looking for some honest advice from folks who’ve negotiated with Google recently.
    

Context: New-grad/early-career SWE matched with a team in Los Angeles. I’m currently a full-time SWE at Coinbase (started a few months ago).
    

My current comp (Coinbase):


      Base: $151,500


      Annual bonus: none


      Equity: $50k/yr (=$200k over 4 yrs)
    

      Sign-on: $10k


      Remote
    

Google offer (L3, LA):


      Base: $142,000


      Annual bonus: 15% target (~$21.3k at target)
    

      Equity: $90k / 4 yrs (front-loaded: 38/32/20/10)
    

No sign-on


      Equity refresh eligible
    

      Hybrid in-office (I already live in LA, but would need to buy a car)
    

      I politely tried to negotiate (asked for something like $160k base, $200k/4y equity to match current, and a $25k sign-on to offset moving from fully remote to on-site/commute costs). Recruiter’s response: “We can’t negotiate anything unless you have a competing offer from the last 3 months. We can’t consider your current employer’s comp.” She reiterated there’s zero flexibility without that.
    

      I don’t have a fresh competing offer in hand. The recruiter seems really firm on this and I don't think I can get a new offer in time.
    

Questions:


      For Google L3 in LA, is “no movement without a recent competing offer” truly hard policy now? Has anyone gotten equity or sign-on increased without another offer (via hiring manager advocacy)?
    

      If the recruiter is firm, is it worth asking for the hiring manager to review a small adjustment (e.g., sign-on for on-site transition, or bump in equity) — or is that just spinning wheels?
    

      If the answer is really “no,” would you accept as-is and rely on refreshers/promo, or turn this opportunity down?
    

TL;DR: Google L3 offer in LA is ~$142k base + 15% bonus + $90k/4y equity, no sign-on. Coinbase TC today is higher (~$151.5k base + $50k/yr equity). Recruiter says no negotiation unless I show a fresh competing offer. Should I accept or decline?
    

      Appreciate any insight! Happy to clarify details in the comments.
    

      Job hunting as a junior AI/ML engineer is brutal. I was about to graduate and spent four straight months applying everywhere, startups, labs, even freelance gigs. Nothing. Not a single callback.
    

      At one point, I even looked into those career consulting agencies that promised guaranteed interviews, until I saw the prices. Out of desperation, I figured maybe I could at least make a small portfolio site to look more legit.
    

      So I used MGX, nothing fancy. I uploaded my resume PDF and gave it one simple prompt: "Turn this resume into a clean, functional portfolio site deployable on Vercel. Use only the exact information and links from my resume, ensure every link works and all functions run properly. Here are my project GitHub links to include. Please replace the phone number field with a 'Schedule a Call' button linking to my calendar, and keep the section headers clickable for navigation."
    

      Two minutes later, I had a fully built page with all my resume sections intact, just a free personal blog template that I tweaked to showcase my work. I dropped the link on LinkedIn and X, and within three weeks, things completely changed.
    

      I started getting messages from recruiters. Real ones. Then came interview requests, more than ten in less than a month, and a couple of part time remote offers for small AI automation projects.
    

      I'm now working full time, finally, and still earn $150-$300 a week from one of those side projects.
    

      I know it sounds a bit dramatic, but that tiny website literally flipped my job search around.
    

      For anyone stuck in the same boat, seriously, just build something visible. Even a simple AI generated portfolio makes you stand out way more than another PDF resume floating in someone's inbox.
    

      Would love to hear if anyone else had a similar AI tool changed my job hunt moment.

      Hey everyone,
    

      I’m starting my bachelor’s in Computer Science in about 2.5 months, and I really want to use this time to get a solid head start. I have access to pretty much all the courses there.
    

      I’m very dedicated and I don’t just want to explore casually, I want to actually build a strong foundation so I can be ahead once classes begin.
    

      Here’s what I’m planning so far:

      Really appreciate any insight, I’m trying to make these next two months really count.

      Posts must ask a question.
    

      Off-topic questions include those about general tech support, software development careers, program debugging, specific questions about particular frameworks or libraries, laptop recommendations, requests for topic ideas to write your paper on, or other questions not related to topics that might be taught by a university computer science department.
    

      If you post code or pseudo-code, it must be properly formatted.
    

      Offensive content includes anything that is uncivil, hateful, NSFW or otherwise inappropriate.
    

      It's perfectly fine to ask questions about concepts from your homework, or to seek clarification or explanation of a problem.  But it's not acceptable to post homework problems looking for others to solve them for you.  You are expected to follow the academic standards of your institution.
    

      When you ask a question and get answers in the subreddit, everyone benefits.  When you redirect people's answers to your private survey, the community loses this benefit.  For this reason, surveys are not allowed.  Exceptions can be made for legitimate academic research, but please message the mods for permission before posting.

      Hello everyone,I am working on a project with heavy computations in rust. I would like to do an implementation of the Strassen algorithm. However I know that for little matrices the algorithm is quite inefficient but I have absolutely now idea how I could determine a good threshold. Should I just to an heuristic based on different threshold ? Or is there a "classical" threshold generally considered as a default one ?
    

      Recently, I've been into processor architecture, low-level mathematics and its applications etc.
    

      But to the point: I achieved computing 10^9th prime number in <400 ms and 10^10th in 3400ms.
    

      Stack: c++, around 500 lines of code, no external dependency, single thread Apple M3 Pro. The question is does an algorithm of this size and performance class have any value?
    

      (I know about Kim Walisch but he does a lot of heavier stuff, 50k loc etc)
    

      PS For now I don't want to publish the source code, I am just asking about performance
    

      Been experimenting with compact board engines, so I made QuantumOX, a Tic Tac Toe engine designed more as a search algorithm sandbox than a toy game.
    

      It currently uses Minimax and Negamax, with layered evaluation functions to separate pure terminal detection from heuristic scoring.
    

      The idea is to keep the framework clean enough to plug in new evaluation logic later or even parallel search methods.
    

      It's not meant to "solve" Tic Tac Toe - it's more of a sandbox for experimenting with search depth control, evaluation design, and performance in a tiny state space.
    

      Repo link: https://github.com/Karuso1/QuantumOX


      Would appreciate code feedback or thoughts on extending the architecture, feel free to contribute!
    

The repository is still under development, but contributions are welcome!

      websites today take a monstrosity amount of ram and resources even if its just bare text
    

      i was wondering if web browsers are still able to manage and load old websites with low resources or mafbe theyre just so outdated that aint possible to program like that no more
    

      HI,
    

      I am a programmer with four years of experience. At work, I stopped using AI 90% of the time six months ago, and I am grateful for that.
    

      However, I still have a few projects (mainly for my studies) where I can't stop prompting due to short deadlines, so I can't afford to write on my own. And I regret that very much. After years of using AI, I know that if I had written these projects myself, I would now know 100 times more and be a 100 times better programmer.
    

      I write these projects and understand what's going on there, I understand the code, but I know I couldn't write it myself.
    

      Every new project that I start on my own from today will be written by me alone.
    

      Let this post be a warning to anyone learning to program that using AI gives only short-term results. If you want to build real skills, do it by learning from your mistakes.
    

      EDIT: After deep consideration i just right now removed my master's thesis project cause i step into some strange bug connected with the root architecture generated by ai. So tommorow i will start by myself, wish me luck
    

      By this I mean in certain circumstances a machine code instruction results in behaviour that it wasn't intended to.
    

      If such a bug existed it seems like it would be catastrophic because it would effect every language and wouldn't be able to be fixed without physically replacing the CPU in every machine, so I am wondering if this has happened and how they test to avoid that.

      For example, linking to some tweet or some half-hearted blog post which links to the page is not ok; but linking to a tweet with interesting replies or to a blog post that does some extra analysis is.
    

      Udemy coupon links are ok: the discount adds "additional value".

      I had an interview today where they asked me a bunch of random theory questions about frameworks I’ve never even touched outside of tutorials. Meanwhile, my actual job experience has been building and maintaining production apps fixing bugs, handling async issues, writing clean code under deadlines.It’s crazy how interviews sometimes feel disconnected from real world web dev. I can explain how I built an entire front-end system but apparently not knowing the internal difference between two rendering methods makes me less prepared.Is this just how interviews are now? Do you guys just study for whatever trendy question set is going around, or try to steer the conversation back to what you actually do

      I’ve been learning JavaScript for a bit now, and honestly — some days it makes total sense, other days it’s pure chaos.
    

      But then out of nowhere, something finally clicks. For me, it was understanding how async/await actually works behind the scenes. Suddenly, callbacks and promises didn’t look so scary anymore.
    

      It’s such a weirdly satisfying feeling when your brain goes, “Ohhh… that’s what it means.”
    

      Curious — what was the one JavaScript concept that finally made sense after confusing you for ages?Closures? Hoisting? The event loop? Share yours..

      Guys, is this normal?! I’ve been working on a Next.js project for 7 months and NORMALLY using TypeScript, and everything has been running perfectly,  clean structure, proper types, no real issues.
    

      Now, someone new just joined and suggested converting the entire codebase back to JavaScript, claiming that “TypeScript overcomplicates things and creates technical debt.”


      The shocking part? They actually agreed with him, and he’s already doing the conversion, even planning to go to production like this, and he wants me to help!
    

      Am I overreacting, or is this completely insane? Because honestly, I’m beyond pissed right now.
    

      was playing around with https://letsjam.pages.dev/ (a reactjs app) that has websockets enabled that allows you to play around with multiple other people realtime. I wonder how the updates are happening? would it have a store like zustand that enables the socket messages throughout the app? or would context actually work in this case? how to go about with sockets + state management in a realtime react app without it bothering other elements in the page (with the sockets being hyper interactive)?

      With the recent news about mass layoffs of the MySQL staff at Oracle, no git commits in real time on GitHub since a long time ago, and with the new releases, there are clear signs that Oracle isn't adding new features. A lot of architects and DBAs are now scrambling for migration plans (if still on MySQL, many moved to MariaDB already).
    

      For those running their own custom app with full freedom to rearchitect the stack, or using the database via an ORM that allows them to easily switch the database, many seem to be planning to migrate to PostgreSQL, which is mature and has a large and real open source community and wide ecosystem support.
    

      What would the reasons be to not migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL? Is autovacuuming in PostgreSQL still slow and logical replication tricky? Does the famous Uber blog post about PostgreSQL performance isues still hold? What is the most popular multi-master replication solution in PostgreSQL (similar to Galera)?
    

      I’m planning a classic replication setup on MySQL 8 (1 primary + 2 replicas), and considering Orchestrator for failover/switchover and topology management.
    

      But the GitHub repo shows "This repository was archived by the owner on Feb 18, 2025. It is now read-only."
    

      So is Orchestrator still stable and reliable for MySQL 8 classic (GTID-based) replication today?

      We actively use pgvector in a production setting for maintaining and querying HNSW vector indexes used to power our recommendation algorithms. A couple of weeks ago, however, as we were adding many more candidates into our database, we suddenly noticed our query times increasing linearly with the number of profiles, which turned out to be a result of incorrectly structured and overly complicated SQL queries.
    

      Turns out that I hadn't fully internalized how filtering vector queries really worked. I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed.
    

      I searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation.
    

      Now, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:
    

      - Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them- Directions for even further optimizations and learning
    

      Hopefully it helps, whether you're building standard RAG systems, fully agentic AI applications or good old semantic search!

      I have a free-tier redis cloud instance that I am trying to connect to with BullMQ for background asynchronous tasks. For some reason I get a Connection Error even though the redis client process I have running connects to the redis cloud instance successfully with the same configurations. It seems BullMQ is trying to connect to localhost even though my config settings are for the cloud instance.
    

      I am working on a coding challenge to Build Your Own Redis Server. I am encountering few challenges:
    

      Let's the say the message received to the server is pipelined, like follows:
    

      Here the client is sending 2 commands in one message, one to echo some string and other to ping the client. The first command should fail (as it is invalid, doesn't contain argument to ECHO) and then it should somehow detect that there is second command and process that.
    

      Let's say the message received to the server is incomplete but the next message received is a completely new command:
    

      Here the server should detect that first message is incomplete and wait for next message. But, the next message is a completely different command. Server should ignore the first message and process the second message.
    

      My current parsing logic doesn't handle this. It is implemented as follows:
    

      Read the message from network socket
    

      Parse it
    

      If successful, process the command and return the output
    

      If not, return the error
    

      How do I detect if there are two commands in one message? Also, how to process further if first command in the message is invalid or incomplete? Also, is there any way to check what happens if the RESP message in example 2 is sent to official Redis server?
    

      I am using C++ and Asio.

      I have a complex relationship with LLMs. At work, I'm told they're the best thing since the invention of the internet, electricity, or , and that I'll lose my job to people who do use them if I won't (I know I won't lose my job). Yes, standard "there are some amazing use cases, like the breast cancer imaging diagnostics" applies, and I think it's good for those like senior leaders where "close enough" is all they need. Yet, on the front line in a regulated industry where "close enough" doesn't cut it,  what I see on a daily basis are models that:
    

      (a) can't be trained on our data for legal and regulatory reasons and so have little to no context with which to help me in my role. Even if they could be trained on our company's data, most of the documentation - if it even exists to begin with - is wrong and out of date.
    

      (b) are suddenly getting worse (looking at you, Claude) at coding help, largely failing at context memory in things as basic as a SQL script - it will make up the names to tables and fields that have clearly, explicitly been written out just a few lines before. Yes they can help create frameworks that I can then patch up, but I do notice degradation in performance.
    

      (c) always manage to get *something* wrong, making my job part LLM babysitter. For example, my boss will use Teams transcribe for our 1:1s and sends me the AI recap after. I have to sift through because it always creates action items that were never discussed, or quotes me saying things that were never said in the meeting by anyone. One time, it just used a completely different name for me throughout the recap.
    

      Having seen how the proverbial sausage is made, I have no desire to use it in my personal life, because why would I use it for anything with any actual stakes? And for the remainder, Google gets me by just fine for things like "Who played the Sheriff in Blazing Saddles?"
    

      Anyone else feel this way, or have a weird relationship with the technology that is, for better or worse, "transforming" our field?
    

      Update: some folks are leaving short, one sentence responses to the effect of "They've only been great for me." Good! Tell us more about how you're finding success in your applications. any frustrations along the way? let's have a CONVERSATION.
    

      Hi there friends,

      hi guys, for a project i need a large dataset that’s uncleaned so that i can show i can clean it and make visualizations and draw analysis from it. if anyone can help please reach out thank you so much.
    

      Hi folks,
    

      I work on the data science team at AirROI, we are one of the largest Airbnb data analytics platform.
    

      FYI, we've released free Airbnb datasets on nearly 1,000 largest markets, and we're releasing it for free to the community. This is one of the most granular free datasets available, containing not just listing details but critical performance metrics like trailing-twelve-month revenue, occupancy rates, and future calendar rates. We also refresh this free datasets on monthly basis.
    

Direct Download Link (No sign-up required):www.airroi.com/data-portal -> then download from each market
    

      The data is structured into several interconnected tables, provided as CSV files per market.
    

1. Listings Data (65 Fields)This is the core table with detailed property information and—most importantly—performance metrics.
    

Core Attributes: listing_id, listing_name, property_type, room_type, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, amenities (list), bedrooms, baths.
    

Host Info: host_id, host_name, superhost status, professional_management flag.
    

Performance & Revenue Metrics (The Gold):


ttm_revenue / ttm_revenue_native (Total revenue last 12 months)
    

ttm_avg_rate / ttm_avg_rate_native (Average daily rate)
    

ttm_occupancy / ttm_adjusted_occupancy


ttm_revpar / ttm_adjusted_revpar (Revenue Per Available Room)
    

l90d_revenue, l90d_occupancy, etc. (Last 90-day snapshot)
    

ttm_reserved_days, ttm_blocked_days, ttm_available_days


2. Calendar Rates Data (14 Fields)Monthly aggregated future pricing and availability data for forecasting.
    

Key Fields: listing_id, date (monthly), vacant_days, reserved_days, occupancy, revenue, rate_avg, booked_rate_avg, booking_lead_time_avg.
    

3. Reviews Data (4 Fields)Temporal review data for sentiment and volume analysis.
    

Key Fields: listing_id, date (monthly), num_reviews, reviewers (list of IDs).
    

4. Host Data (11 Fields) Coming SoonProfile and portfolio information for hosts.
    

Key Fields: host_id, is_superhost, listing_count, member_since, ratings.
    

      Most free datasets stop at basic listing info. This one includes the performance data needed for serious analysis:
    

Investment Analysis: Model ROI using actual ttm_revenue and occupancy data.
    

Pricing Strategy: Analyze how rate_avg fluctuates with seasonality and booking_lead_time.
    

Market Sizing: Use professional_management and superhost flags to understand market maturity.
    

Geospatial Studies: Plot revenue heatmaps using latitude/longitude and ttm_revpar.
    

Academic Research: Economics, urban studies, and platform economy research.
    

Competitive Analysis: Benchmark property performance against market averages.
    

Machine Learning: Build models to predict occupancy or revenue based on amenities, location, and host data.
    

Data Visualization: Create dashboards showing revenue density, occupancy calendars, and amenity correlations.
    

Portfolio Projects: A fantastic dataset for a standout data science portfolio piece.
    

      The data is provided under a permissive license for academic and personal use. We request attribution to AirROI in public work.
    

      This free dataset is updated monthly. If you need real-time, hyper-specific data, or larger historical dumps, we offer a low-cost API for developers and researchers:www.airroi.com/api


      Alternatively, we also provide bespoke data services if your needs go beyond the scope of the free datasets.
    

      We hope this data is useful. Happy analyzing!
    

      Can anyone help with some resource which has a full case study that I can work on and if possible there is a solution that I can compare with. The solution part is not a must. Just looking for a case study to try my hands on. Thanks

      We trained a vision model that passed every validation test in the lab. Once deployed to real cameras, performance dropped sharply. Some cameras faced windows, others had LED flicker, and a few had different firmware or slight focus shifts. None of this showed up in our internal validation.
    

      We collect short field clips from each camera and test them, but it still feels like an unstructured process. I’m trying to understand how teams approach large-scale validation when every camera acts like its own domain.
    

      Do you cluster environments, build per-camera test sets, or rely on adaptive retraining after deployment? What does a scalable “field readiness” validation step look like in your experience?
    

      arxiv-sanity-lite stopped being hosted a few months back.
    

      I made a spiritual clone, arxiv troller with the goal of doing the same thing but with less jank. You can group papers into tags and search for similar papers, like with arxiv-sanity. You can also search for similar papers to a single paper, if you're just interested in just looking into a topic. The search works pretty well, and hopefully won't get pulled down to a crawl in the way that a-s did.
    

      In the near future, I'm planning on adding citation-based similarity to the search and the ability for you to permanently remove undesired results from your tag searches.
    

      Would love to hear feature feedback (although I don't planning on expanding beyond basic search and paper org features), but most of all just for some people to use it if they miss a-s

      I literally do not understand how a future with AI in the USA could possibly ever work. Say that AI is so incredibly effective and well developed in two years that it eliminates 50% of all work that we have to do. Okay? What in the actual fuck are the white collar employees, just specifically for example, supposed to do? What exactly are these people going to spend their time doing now that most of their work is completely eliminated? Do we lay off half of the white collar workers in the USA and they just become homeless and starve to death?


      And I keep seeing this really stupid, yes very stupid, comment that "they'll just have to learn how to do something else!" Okay, how does a 51-year-old woman who has done clerical work for most of her life with no college degree swap to something like plumbing, HVAC, door-to-door sales, or whatever People are imagining that workers are going to do? Not everyone is a young able-bodied 20-year-old fresh out of college with a 4-year degree and 150K in student loan debt. Like seriously, there is no way someone in there late 40s or late '50s is going to be able to pivot to a brand new career especially one that is physically demanding and hard on your body if you haven't been doing that your whole life. Literally impossible.
    

And even if people moved to trades, then trades would no longer pay well. Like let's say that 10 million people were displaced from White collar jobs and went to work a trade like HVAC or plumbing, even though this realistically could never happen because there aren't that many jobs in those fields... But let's say for the sake of stupidity that it did happen. supply and demand tells us that those jobs would no longer pay well at all. Since there's now a huge influx of new people going into it, they'd probably be paid a lot less, I would imagine that they would start out around the same salary as someone at McDonald's

      hey guys,
    

      I'm thinking about doing a small NLP project where I find poems in one language that are similar in content or emotion to poems in another language.
    

      It's not about translations, but about whether models can recognize semantic and emotional similarities across language barriers, for example grief, love, anger etc.
    

      Models I was thinking of BM25 as a simple baseline, Sentence-BERT or LaBSE for cross-linguistic embeddings. Emotion recognition (joy, sadness, anger, love…) with pre-trained emotion classifiers
    

      Evaluation: Manually check whether the found poems have a similar thematic/emotional impact?
    

      To see if retrieval models can work with poetry and especially if one or the other model works better. Is this technically realistic for a short project (a month or so?)
    

      I'm not planning any training, just applying existing models.
    

      Most AI writing sounds clean and well-structured, but something about it still feels slightly mechanical, like it’s missing rhythm or emotion. There’s a growing focus on tools that humanize AI writing, such as Humalingo, which reshapes text so it flows like real human writing and even passes AI detectors. It makes me wonder, what do you think actually makes writing feel human? Word choice, tone, or just imperfection?
    

      hi all
    

      i'm planning to apply for a masters in computational linguistics / language technology as an international (non EU/EEA) student. i've done research on programs and have narrowed down on these few:
    

      uppsala's MA language technology masters
    

      tübingen's MA computational linguistics
    

      stockholm's MA AI and language
    

      stuttgart's MSc Computational Linguistics
    

      konstanz's MA speech and language processing
    

      helsinki's MA linguistic diversity and digital humanities (language technology track)
    

      potsdam's MSc cognitive systems
    

      coming from a linguistic background (bachelor with honours), i'm looking at 2 year programs as i believe i'd be able to learn more programming theory + technical skills that would better equip me for an industry role in the tech sector. i'm thus not as keen on 1 year programs such as leiden's linguistics (comp ling track), VU's linguistics language and AI, or groningen's speech technology programs. i'm learning python online to gain some basic proficiency in programming before starting the masters.
    

      uppsala and tübingen are my top 2 choices if i were to be accepted, particularly because they seem more accessible to prospective students from a linguistic background based on my research. i'm hoping to gain more information about these two cities and their programs based on people's personal experience so that i can make an informed choice. these are my questions:
    

ACCESSIBILITY: how accessible is the program for those with a linguistic background? accessible could mean being less CS-intensive, or that there are foundational classes in programming/ML/AI to help those with a humanities background ease into the program with less difficulty
    

TEACHING QUALITY: what's your experience with the quality of teaching, how well organised the course is, helpfulness of professors, whether studying resources are provided or you'd have to source for your own materials, etc
    

JOB OPPORTUNITIES: in which city would an international student find it easier to get a job after graduating?
    

HEALTHCARE: how easy is it to get a medical appointment for minor and major illnesses in the city, both as a student and after graduation?
    

SOCIAL LIFE: how open people are to making new (local) friends, especially if one is not fluent in Swedish (for uppsala) or German (for tübingen)?
    

ACTIVITIES: which city has more options for activities if i'm not a huge fan of partying, alcohol, pub crawls? (occasional outings for special occassions are fine, but it's not something i would do frequently or particularly enjoy) i'm open to hiking, bouldering, music events, board games, reading, or any other activity
    

TRANSPORT: how well-connected and accessible is public transport within these cities, and also from the city to other cities?
    

COST OF LIVING: it seems like living costs (on numbeo) are generally lower in uppsala than tübingen (which is counter to my initial impression that CoL is higher in nordic countries) and i'm wondering if this is really the case? i've also read comments that tübingen is an expensive city to live in - would this make the cost of living in tübingen 'comparable' to uppsala?
    

QUALTITY OF LIFE: how would you describe the overall quality of life in uppsala/tübingen, and if you have experience living in both, is the quality of life noticeably better in one of the cities? (my impression is that anywhere in the nordics would have a better quality of life but i'd like to hear your experience if you've lived there)
    

      i'd be grateful if you could share your experience in uppsala and/or tübingen, or if you have experience with the other programs (and countries). thanks so much!
    

      TLDR: international student (non EU/EEA) with BA (Honours) in Linguistics looking for advice on whether to choose uppsala or tübingen for masters in computational linguistics/language technology

      A few months back we deployed a vision model that looked great in testing. Lab accuracy was solid, validation numbers looked perfect, and everyone was feeling good.
    

      Then we rolled it out to the actual cameras. Suddenly, detection quality dropped like a rock. One camera faced a window, another was under flickering LED lights, a few had weird mounting angles. None of it showed up in our pre-deployment tests.
    

      We spent days trying to debug if it was the model, the lighting, or camera calibration. Turns out every camera had its own “personality,” and our test data never captured those variations.
    

      That got me wondering: how are other teams handling this? Do you have a structured way to test model performance per camera before rollout, or do you just deploy and fix as you go?
    

      I’ve been thinking about whether a proper “field-readiness” validation step should exist, something that catches these issues early instead of letting the field surprise you.
    

      Curious how others have dealt with this kind of chaos in production vision systems.

      I'm currently preparing for a network engineer interview, which focuses more on logical reasoning than command-line operations. They seem more interested in how I think about problems than whether I can type "show ip bgp summary". I've been setting up a small lab environment with EVE-NG and GNS3, capturing packets with Wireshark, and using the Beyz interview helper to simulate the interview and explain my configuration. Playing back the recordings, I realized I tend to skip steps when I speak.
    

      For example, I can describe the path selection order (weight → local priority → AS path → source address → MED → eBGP/iBGP → IGP metric → router ID), but I get stuck when asked why I used a specific policy-based route mapping. My explanations sound like rote recitation.
    

      I never thought I'd need to "practice spoken language" during network learning preparation. I'm still trying to find a method that will be effective in the long run. How can I train myself to avoid sounding like a robot when explaining complex topics such as BGP, OSPF design, or VRF decoupling?
    

      I'm reaching a point where I'm actually growing concerned about my future. I'm always skilling up, always have. I believe as a network engineer in a business that is constantly growing, if you stop, you die. So, I've gone from being a CCNP and JNCIP-IP, on into cloud (mostly AWS mostly with data/ML and cloud networks and Solutions using data/ML to forecast networks utilization, predict failures, automate stuff), I'm great at math, (linear alg, calc, multivariate calc), Python, Ansible, Terraform, JSON, YAML, XML, Ruby, Linux of course, idk, what else? .....anyway, I've been trying to jump from my current company for professional reason, mainly lack of growth, but I feel like no employer out there needs my whole skillset and certainly doesn't want to pay for it (I'm happy with $120k and up) and I need to work remote because of where I live (really no opportunities where I live).
    

      I also wonder if my age has anything to do with it despite having always been told the opposite in the pre-Covid years, how mgrs wanted experienced engineers over whatever else, but man, some of these younger guys just seems to think clearer, faster. I don't want to retire until my 70s, honestly; I love what I do and I need the income.  How are some of the rest of us 45+ dealing with the job market these days. A lot of different from when I first started.
    

      I am working with a client to revamp small offices (under 50 users).  While my design instincts tell me to deploy dual firewalls in HA and dual core switches, the budgets might not allow this.
    

      It's also a problem that in some of the sites, the ISPs are unable to provide path diversity, or if they can, the cost is astronomical. Whats the use of having two ISP or the same ISP delivering on two phsical interfaces if the path back to the CO is the same?
    

      How are you doing HA when either the feasibility doenst quite match up? cold spares?

      More and more I see projects calling themselves FOSS alternatives to popular tools, and the first thing on their landing page is a pricing section.
    

      Sure, they might let you self-host it with Docker or something, but… why do I need to host a video editor and open it in the browser? Just let me install it like a normal program.
    

      I'm not trying to bash on FOSS projects — I obviously get the need for income, and I even support a few projects myself.
    

      It’s just that so many of these come from web devs using Next.js, React, etc, and it feels like every project now has a cloud dashboard and subscription tier attached.
    

      Maybe that's just where software development is heading as a whole, given how many Electron-based products we see nowadays.

      I’m a fullstack software developer working remotely for 3 different companies at the same time (yeah, lots of context-switching😅). I’ve been experimenting with different AI tools to improve both my productivity and overall development experience, and I’m curious to hear what’s actually working for others.
    

Here’s what I currently use:


Krips.ai: to record meetings, generate transcripts, and summaries. It’s been a time-saver when juggling multiple teams and projects.
    

ChatGPT: my main go-to. I have a separate project/workspace for each company and fed it all the internal docs, so it acts like a smart teammate familiar with each environment.
    

Windsuft, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Trae: as code agents. They’re great for quick refactors, writing docs, or explaining code. Currently testing Windsuft and looks promising so far. Trae has been the least helpful for me personally.
    

Gitingest: super handy for turning an entire GitHub repo into plain text so I can feed it into AI tools for better context.
    

Gemini: my personal assistant for managing tasks, scheduling events, and keeping a structured daily workflow.
    

      I’m wondering what other tools you’ve found genuinely useful. Any underrated gems or setups that have made a real difference for you?
    

      I am developing management software for postal workers. My goal is to create documentation that keeps pace with the development itself. Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how to do this? What processes should I follow? I really want to create software documentation, not just a simple README file. Are there any models to follow for software documentation?
    

      I’ve been developing a software for the past two years bootstrapping it myself. I’ve been pretty serious since the beginning of this year, but I just can’t get out of the funk of stopping midway through a section and not touching it again for weeks. Has anyone found a method or do something to help them get through the burnout?
    

      I’m not too interested in having anyone else work on the core of the software. I’ve had devs test the parts I’ve completed but that’s about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

      Hi all, very simple question here.
    

      When following a trunk-based merging strategy, the process I typically follow is:
    

      Update and branch off of main,
    

      Make some changes over time,
    

      (If main changes) Update main again,
    

      Rebase into feature branch,
    

      Force push to rewrite history, as new main changes are now before my feature.
    

      Just curious on whether casually force pushing like this is at all frowned upon or if it's normal practice for your own unprotected branches.
    

      I’ve always wondered why version control tools like Git became a standard in software engineering but never really spread to other fields.Designers, writers, architects even researchers could benefit from versioning their work but they rarely (never ?) use git.Is it because of the complexity of git, the culture of coding, or something else ?Curious to hear your thoughts
    

      I don't know why but, I switch machines every year. Yesterday I migrated again and had to re-clone my repos.I have 12 github repos in total, but I only needed 8 of them.
    

      Instead of manually running git clone <url> again and again that can cost 5 min of my precious time⏳…I spent 4 hours building a script that lets me choose exactly which repos to clone 😌I agree that StackOverflow had solutions to clone ALL repos using gitHub CLI.But I wanted a script to select / exclude repos based on my need and without using gh CLI.So I built one. With this script, you can clone all your desired repos just by passing your username. This was useful for me, So I thought about sharing it

      Honestly, I’ve experienced burnout a couple of times now. Maybe I’m just terrible at managing my time, studies, and stress. Those huge gaps in my commits? Yeah, that’s me just contemplating life and avoiding anything tech-related for weeks. T_T
    

      At this point, I’ve seriously considered becoming a farmer LMAO.
    

      How do you guys stay consistent without completely frying your brain?
    

Observation: Personally, I’ve found GitHub Copilot in VS Code (Agent Mode) to perform significantly better for coding tasks compared to the GitHub Copilot Agent.
    

Discussion Point:I’m curious to hear feedback from others — specifically regarding output quality (not latency or speed) when using Copilot for test case generation or test writing.Have you observed similar differences in quality between the two workflows?

      C++26 introduced std::inplace_vector<T, N>. The type is trivially copyable as long as T is trivially copyable. On first look this seems like a good thing to have, but when trying it in production environment in some scenarios it leads to quite a big performance degradation compared to std::vector.I.e. if inplace_vector capacity is big, but actually size is small, the trivial copy constructor will copy all elements, instead of only up to size() elements.
    

      Was this drawback raised during the design of the class?

      This post is not directly related to .NET. I am a full stack developer in the US with .NET and Azure skills for backend development. That's what shows up in my resume and Linkedin. I am not actively seeking any positions.
    

      During Covid, I was getting a lot of emails and phone calls from recruiters. Then it died out for about the past two years and now for the past like 3 months, it suddenly picked up a lot  with emails and phones. Now every day my spam folder has emails from recruiters. It used to be for weeks I didn't get any.
    

      I have been hearing about the layoffs this year. Amazon, Microsoft and other big companies.I also hear about the bad job market for developers.
    

      So what's going on? Why are recruiters contacting me out of a sudden? It doesn't make much sense to me. Layoffs should be producing more people seeking jobs and recruiters should be getting a ton of resumes and job applications. I don't see them needing to contact developers.Plus the job market stinks and remote developers from all over the world are applying for US jobs. I know there are some scam jobs. I am not sure if these scam jobs have suddenly increased a lot.
    

      Then I was thinking about the $100,000 fee for H-1B visas. Are companies now starting to hire local US developers and this is causing an uptick? They can't afford developers from India to work in the US. I mean they can offshore these remote jobs to India.
    

      Plus don't companies not hire during the last quarter of the year? Holidays and stuff.
    

      What are your thoughts?
    

      IWebhost is officially obsolete, so you will need to use IHost moving forward - legacy apps (even up to .NET 9) could be using it without showing warnings. And if you have <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> set, this would be a breaking change, but a fairly simple fix nevertheless.
    

      dotnet restore now audits transitive packages by default, not just direct dependencies like before. Once again, If you have <TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors> set, then this could be a potential blocker, so something to be aware of for sure - as you might need to look for another library, postpone or other.
    

      Starting with .NET 10, Microsoft’s official Docker images will begin to use Ubuntu as their base operating system, instead of Debian or Alpine. This could introduce behavioral changes so be aware of it.
    

      Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> now supports implicit conversion, which could cause ambiguity in certain cases. Something to keep in mind as well.
    

      dotnet new sln creates the new .slnx format by default, which shouldn't really be an issue, but is a good reminder to migrate projects from the older format to the newer XML-based format introduced in .NET 9 release. One of the favorite updates.
    

      Field-backed properties/field keyword - this one shouldn't really be a problem unless some properties have a backing field called field, and even then, simply remove the backing field and let it use the new field keyword instead, nice and easy. I would assume this should not be a common problem as POCOs primarily consist of auto-properties and domain entities/objects have simple validation within methods.
    

      AsyncEnumerable is now part of the unified base class library. It used to be separately hosted as System.Linq.Async. When migrating make sure you remove the old Nuget package to make sure it does not cause ambiguity.
    

      Will update overtime if anything else comes up while testing - hope it helps those deciding to migrate.

      I let a little small API grow into a 12-project hydra and now I’m fighting circular references like it’s my job.
    

      It started clean: Web → Application → Domain, with Infrastructure for EF Core. Then someone sprinkled EF attributes into entities, a helper in Web needed a Domain enum, Application started returning EF types, and boom, cycles. Renaming “Common” to “Shared” didn’t help...
    

      I’ve been refactoring it as a “practice project” for my upcoming system design interviews. I’m using it to test my understanding of clean architecture boundaries while also simulating design-explanation sessions with beyz coding assistant, kind of like a mock interview. I found that explaining dependency direction out loud exposes way more confusion than I thought.
    

      Right now I’m stuck between keeping Domain EF-free versus letting Infrastructure leak mapping attributes. Same issue with DTOs: do you keep contracts in Application or make a standalone Contracts lib? And how do you keep “Shared” from turning into “EverythingElse”? If you’ve got a real example or advice on where to place contracts, I’d love to hear it!

      It feels like moving from Level 13 to 14 is a huge step up..I  know keys from PGP etc, but I am wondering why the private key from one user should work to log in to the account of another user.. Sure, this level is set up to teach this stuff, but am I correct thinking that the private key is per user of a machine, and not for the entire computer, so this level represents a very unlikely scenario? Why should I be able to download the private key from User 13 to log into the machine as User 14, in a real-world scenario - or am I missing something?
    

      Here is the solution to get to Level 14 -  you log into Bandit13, find the private key, log out, download the key because you know where it is and have the password, and then use the private key from bandit13 to log into bandit14.. (For example https://mayadevbe.me/posts/overthewire/bandit/level14/)

      Hi all, a decent while ago i started getting into VPS and self hosting and wanted to learn all the ins and outs.
    

      I thought, why not learn command line and Linux for hosting by creating scripts using bash hehe oh was i in for a ride.
    

      Ive learned a damn lot, and just wanted to share my learning experience. (I kinda went overboard on how i share it lol, lets just say i had a lot of fun evenings)
    

      I basically made a toolkit, that has the concepts,  and best practices i learned, and its in a nice looking TUI now. I like how its so powerful without any real depencies. You can do so much!! Unbelievable
    

      I would love some feedback and opinions on it of you who know lots more about bash than I do so i can learn!!
    

      Its free and open source under MIT: https://github.com/kelvincdeen/kcstudio-launchpad-toolkit


      (Yes i used ai to help me. But i understand and know what all critical parts do because thats important to me). And yes i know the scripts are gigantic, its all build on focused functions and makes it easier for me to see the big picture.
    

      Would love your opinions on it, the good and the critique so i can do better next time

      This rule is interpreted generously; general shell scripting content is mostly accepted. However, the post should not be specific to another shell.
    

      This is meant with regards to content, not just “the same link was submitted earlier” – it’s okay to resubmit an old link in some new context (e. g. because you’d like to discuss another part of it, or because something has changed since the last time it was submitted, or because the link was updated since then). Links from the sidebar count as having been submitted already, so posting them without new context is also considered a repost.
    

      Spam, Shilling, Trolling, and other malicious comments or suggestions, e.g. rm -rf / are neither funny nor encouraged. Repeated or egregious violations will lead to a permanent ban.
    

      Posts and comments should not promote code or projects that are reasonably identifiable as "AI slop".

      Is anybody still using TUI applications for business?
    

      My family company is a wholesale distribution firm (with lightweight manufacturing) and has been using the same TUI application (on prem unix box) since 1993. We use it for customer management, ordering, invoicing, kit management/build tickets, financials - everything. We've transitioned from green screen terminals to modern emulators, but the core system remains. I spent many summers running serial and ethernet cables.
    

      I left the business years ago to become a full time software engineer, but I got my start as a script kiddie writing automations for this system with Microsoft Access, VBA, and SendKeys to automate data entry. Amazingly, they still have a Windows XP machine running many of those tasks I wrote back in 2004! It's brittle, but cumulatively has probably saved years of time. That XP machine could survive a nuclear winter lol.
    

      I recently stepped back in to help my parents and spent a day converting many of those old scripts to a more modern system (with actual error-handling instead of strategic sleep()s and prayers) using Python and telnetlib3. I had a blast and still love this application. I can fly around in it. Training new people was always a pain, but for those that got it—they had super powers.
    

      This got me thinking: Are other companies still using this type of interface to drive their core operations? I’m reflecting on whether the only reason my family's business still uses this system is because of the efficiency hacks I put in place 20+ years ago. Without them, would they have been forced to switch to a modern cloud/GUI system? I’m not sure if I’m blinded by nostalgia or if this application is truly as wonderful as I remember it.
    

      I’d love to hear if and how these are still being utilized in the real world.
    

      P.S. The system we use was originally sold by ADP and has had different names (D2K, Prophet21). I believe Epicor owns it now (Activant before).
    

      P.P.S. Is anybody migrating their old TUI automation scripts to a more modern framework or creating new ones? I’m super curious to compare notes and see what other people are doing.
    

      Hey everyone!I recently made a small C tool called zigit — it’s basically a super lightweight alternative to git clone when you only care about downloading the latest source code and not the entire commit history.
    

zigit just grabs the ZIP directly from GitHub’s codeload endpoint using aria2c, which supports parallel and segmented downloads.

      Hi there! My name is Javier Canales, and I work as a content editor at roadmap.sh. For those who don't know, roadmap.sh is a community-driven website offering visual roadmaps, study plans, and guides to help developers navigate their career paths in technology.
    

      We're planning to launch a brand new Shell/Bash Roadmap. It aims to be comprehensive, targeting Shell newbies and mature developers who may want a Shell refresh or improve their fluency. However, we're not covering all the commands or topics out there, as we don't want to overwhelm users with excessive content.
    

      Before launching the roadmap, we would like to ask the community for some help. Here's the link to the draft roadmap. We welcome your feedback, suggestions, and constructive input. Anything you think should be included or removed from the roadmap, please let me know.
    

      Once we launch the official roadmap, we will start populating it with content and resources. Contributions will also be welcome on that side via GitHub :)
    

      Hope this incoming roadmap will also be useful for you. Thanks very much in advance.
    

      What My Project Does:
    

      This project is a TUI(terminal user interface) that hooks up with the Google Tasks Api, allowing you to edit and view your tasks straight from your terminal.
    

      Target Audience:
    

      This is just a toy project and for everyone. It is also open source so feel free to make any contributions.
    

      Comparison:
    

      I'm sure there are other TUIs out there similar to this that allows you to keep track of your tasks/notes. I guess this application is nice because it hooks up with your Google Tasks which allows for cross platform use.

      Let's say I'm writing a short bash script and I realise that some step would be very simple to achieve with vim. What's a recommended way ti "script" using vim commands?
    

      Let's imagine this interactive sequence:
    

      How would I turn that into a script?
    

      For other cases of "shell scripting" with vim - what is there to think about? Caveats?
    

      Notes: ruff is a python linter/formatter that in this case adds lint waivers. git-jump is a part of git that starts vim with preloaded quickfix list. (Unfortunately each hunk gets one entry in qflist instead of each individual line change)

      I really have a hard time with vscode. I am really used to vim shortcuts or emacs, but vscode is so foreign, that it just feels so off.
    

My current MCPs:


      Context7 (2 tools) - cross-conversation memory
    

      Sequential-thinking (1 tool) - better reasoning
    

      Playwright (21 tools) - browser automation
    

      Memory-bank (15 tools) - project-specific context
    

      Supabase(Project MCP Rest Global) (20 tools) - database operations
    

P.S: I'm mainly doing web development with console log debugging, database work, and need persistent memory across sessions. Wondering if I'm over-engineering this or if my setup is reasonable.

      Use English as our common language. Be as descriptive as possible in your posts.

      I know that a text string delimited by \Q and \E at the beginning and end causes all of the characters in the middle to be interpreted literally.  I see 2 possibilities with this regex string--either the \\ in the middle is treated as an escaped backslash so that the string matches \E, or the \\ is treated as 2 separate backslash characters that are interpreted independenly of each other, so that the last backslash is treated as part of \E, and \Q and \E are dropped to leave only a single backslash \.  Which is it?
    

      I’m trying to parse a data from IMDb site. Currently I’m getting the output like below and I want to change the output as in expected. Is there a way to achieve this through regex. Any help would be appreciated.
    

      Current output(sample):
    

Titanic * 1997 * Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet
    

Titanic * 2012 * TV Mini Series * Peter McDonald, Steven
    

      Expected output:
    

      Titanic
    

      Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet
    

      Titanic
    

      Peter McDonald, Steven Waddington

      Three examples of what should match and three examples of what shouldn't match would be helpful.
    

      Every line of code should be indented four spaces or put into a code block.
    

      PCRE, Python, Javascript, Notepad++, Sublime, Google Sheets, etc.
    

      This helps us to be able to see the problem that you are seeing.  If you can put it into regex101.com and link to it from your post, even better.
    
Sometimes, writing regular expressions can be tricky.

      I'm making an interpretered language, it offers exactly nothing new atm that something else doesn't already have and its just basically Ruby/Crystal but worse. But wanted to try making one.
    

      Over the past 2 weeks or so I've been putting in a few complex features so I don't stumble too much on bootstrapping off the donor, the thing has always kind of felt a bit slow but brushed it off since I hadn't bothered with optimisations yet, so to be expected right.
    

      But then curiosity set in. So anyways 1 billion iterations took 60 mins and I thought wow I might not be good at this but hey it's fun and has kept my interest for months now surprisingly.
    

      After everything I add now I run my tests, all examples, and then the benchmark to try and get it down some (normally just run 1 million), and for some reason it just couldn't get out of my head. Why is it slow as christmas.
    

      About 2 days ago I implemented more of the bytecode vm, some tweaks in the hot path but only got 10 mins off, said hell with it and I'll just work on it right before bootstrapping. Today I split up the CLI and replaced the output keyword, because I'm still not sold on what I want the final look of this thing to be but, before I got off for the day I decided to run my tests, examples and then benchmark again.
    

      It was quick...suspiciously quick. Looked at the numbers, thought ain't no way, then ran 1 billion because I was in a meeting anyways so had the time. Only took 4 mins, immediately stunlocked because I had no clue how that happened. 15+ years of programming and I can't figure out why something I wrote magically improved by like 90%.
    

      But then I figured it out, I remembered I spent a good portion of the day adding an .ico to the .exe all because I wanted to see the logo I made and not the default windows icon. I was so in the zone because of a stupid path error that I didn't realize I used the --release flag with the build command. A flag I didn't even think about using beforehand because I normally quit all my side projects by now.
    

      Anyways just wanted to share my little achievement is all. Bye 👋🏼
    

      Just enjoy: https://www.uiua.org/


      At the top of the page there are 14 examples, a few more if you scroll a little
    

      Enjoy!

      This site teachyourselfcs.com has books that i find too theoretical and hardly practical. Like the one book about 'distributed systems' its just like reading phd level stuff. The only book approachable  was computer networks. I am just a high school grad. How should i start in cs. Should i even bother with topics like compilers,architecture,os etc and focus mainly on programing with algs&ds.?
    

      I am trying to get someone to help me with a project, but don't even know the terminology I should be using to describe it, and three people I have approached so far wanted me to pay them full rate just to even discuss it - so I am hoping to save a little and see if I could learn better WHAT I should be saying in slightly more technical terms - so I would like to describe what I want and see if you all could help me better define it for prospective hires... I am currently a member of an organization that has a database available (job listings) for all members with various data in each entry. I am authorized (no funny business here) to take that data and post it on my own website with the exception of certain confidential information. Right now, there is a single platform/app that has integrated this, but they are frankly too costly and bug ridden to consider. I am currently manually copy/pasting or retyping all the data fields into my own website for posting to my partners and networks. I would like to get some sort of script/automation that would allow me to select a listing and have ONLY the appropriate and acceptable fields transferred to my website automatically - can anyone tell me possibly what sort of skills/experience I may want someone to have for this?"
    

      Appreciate any help!

      I have Firebird DB version 5.0 and the Jaybird JDBC driver 6.0.3 using eclipse to create a Java application that connects to a local database at '/home/username/Documents/database.fdb' in Ubuntu. I have jaybird-native-6.0.3-sources.jar and jna-jpms-5.17.0.jar in the classpath under Libraries tab. I'm using code similar to:
    

public class accessDB {
    

      }
    

      }
    

      When I try to run it I get the error messages:
    

      Error loading driver...org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver
    

      java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver
    

      Error connecting to Budget Database No suitable driver found for jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded://home/user/Documents/database.fdb
    

      java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:firebirdsql:embedded://home/user/Documents/database.fdb
    

      What am I doing wrong or where should I check? I can't find much information on the internet about creating embedded connections in FirebirdDB using JDBC. I'm more of a novice so pardon me if there is an easy solution to this.
    

      Hi all; I’m currently running a game of Dungeons and Dragons, and the character list is getting a bit out of hand! I’d like something to keep on top of it all, but I haven’t worked with databases much since school. Each entry would need about a dozen different parameters, for example their name, personality traits, where they live/work, etc. Ideally I’d love to be able to enter artwork for each as well, so I’m not trawling through loads of different things to find it. I’d also like to be able to search each parameter, for example a specific location, and be able to see all the characters that could be found there. I’m working on iPad, and ideally looking for something low cost/free; I don’t feel like I need tons of features beyond what I’ve described, and it is just for personal use. Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
    

      Running a postgres DB, data is ingested from API with python scripts from different APIs. I want to put it in a normalized way according to data needs.
    

      The problem i have is that each entity have a parameter on a specific treatment. However, each API has its own naming schema for the treatment and sometimes they provide a treatment misspelled. I would like to normalize the entity with one treatment X1, but treatment X1 can have 5 different treatment names so without normalization theres X1 - X5 treatments. I was thinking i could deal with this by making a lookup table which lists every type of treatment and has a column with the normalized treatment name which i could specify. Basically a lookup table.
    

      Is this something i shoulddeal with in the DB or in the data cleanup step/ingestion? In python i could load a json with a massive dict containing the lookups. Or is it more feasible to create a table in the DB and let it do its thing on insertion?
    

      Any input is welcome.

      UPDATE: Upgrading from 10.5 to 10.11 from the MariaDB repositories resolved the mysql.sock issue as well as the UUID data type issue.
    

      TL;DR : MariaDB 10.5 on Rocky 9 not creating mysql.sock on startup but otherwise working normally, preventing local access.
    

      I have a VM that is my dedicated DB server for my small business operation.  Basically little more then a glorified homelab.  Apologize in advance for the long post but I want to be complete.   TIA for any help.
    

      A few months ago I rebuilt the VM with Rocky 9.  The data location for the database is a SMB mount from a TrueNAS server at "/mnt/dbdata/mysql".   This non-standard location has caused all sorts of little issues, but "/etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf" is set up correctly.   Permissions are all 700 and mysql is the owner and group.
    

      The setup works and I was/am able to remotely access the DB server from my other VM's and manage the databases using either MySQLWorkbench or DBeaver.   I had to have logged in locally (using "mariadb -u -p") during the setup but I would have quickly switched to accessing via port 3306, so the "mysql.sock" must have been working then.
    

      Recently I was trying to import a schema that used a data type not supported by 10.5, e.g. "UUID".  So a week ago I decided to upgrade to 12.1 (I know...huge jump...probably a poor decision!)
    

      I simply could not get it to work.  The non-standard data location was part of what was biting me in the ass but no matter what I did it would not start properly and the error messages were very non-specific.  After about 6 hours of beating my head against the wall I said "f*** it!" and rolled back to 10.5 and got it all working again.  Importantly, I am not certain that I was able to access the DB via the mysql.sock file after rolling back.
    

      Last night I decided to re-visit the upgrade.  My thought was to do a more modest jump.
    

      However, I discovered I could not connect locally via the socket file.   e.g. . using "mariadb -u root -p" would prompt me for the password but would fail to connect. with error 111
    

      excerpt from "/etc/my.cnf.d/mariadb-server.cnf":datadir=/mnt/dbdata/mysqlsocket=/tmp/mysql.sock
    

      I found that even when the mariadb service was stopped, that the sock file was there.   I deleted it and restarted the service but it did not create the file, even though it shows as listening on it.
    

netstat -ln | grep mysqlunix 2  STREAM LISTENING 31858 /tmp/mysql.sock


      "/tmp/" permissions are 777 and when the mysql.sock file was there it had 600 permissions with "mysql:mysql" ownership.  SElinux is disabled.
    

      With mysql.sock missing trying to connect gives an error number of "2" as one would expect.
    

      When I try changing the location of the socket, mariadbd will not start but the error is not giving me anything I can use.  It simply says " Can't start server : Bind on unix socket: No data available."
    

      I have reviewed "/etc/my.cnf" and all files under "/etc/my.cnf.d/" and there are no conflicting entries.
    

My issue at this point is that, as best as I can tell, mysqld is supposed to create "/tmp/mysql.sock" on startup but that is not happening even though it indicates it is listening at that location.   I can connect locally using the network ("mariadb -u root -p --port=3306 --protocol=tcp") or remotely using MYSQLworkbench/DBeaver but I cannot connect using the socket.


      I would like to fix this before I move to the next step upgrading because it indicates to me that something is not right.   However, since I can connect and back up the DB that is not a must.
    

1) What changes or tests would be recommended?


2) What logs might contain additional information?


3) What additional information can I provide to help gain some insight?

      Hi, I'm interested in cloud speeds for SQL Server on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
    

      Can people please run this very simply script to insert 10,000 rows from SSMS and post times along with drive specs (size and Type of VM if applicable, MiB, IOPS)
    

      If you're on-prem with Gen 5 or Gen 4 please share times as well for comparison - don't worry, I have ample Tylenol next to me to handle the results:-)
    

      I'll share our times but I'm curious to see other people's results to see the trends.
    

      Also, if you also have done periodic benchmarking between 2024 and 2025 on the same machines, please share your findings.

      First, before y’all come at me, I am NOT a DBA and don’t pretend to be one.  I just use SQL server to store some data at work and I am the only one who uses it.  Second, there are no apps or anything connecting to the database.  Third, it’s small.
    

      With that out of the way, this Query Execution Plan thing is amazing and so informative.  It seems I can tell how it’s piecing together the data, and what the processing costs are for each step.  I am going to figure out how to use it.  While the database is small, there are a few queries I don’t mind speeding up a bit.
    

      This reminds me of when I discovered Linq in C#.
    

      At any rate, what are some tips you have about using the execution plan?
    

      Thanks!
    

      Title says it all. I am willing to pay a small amount for this service.

      Hello everyone, first post here, and I was unsure how to flair this, so please let me know if it should be different or if this post does not belong here.
    

      So basically, three other people and I are participating as a team at a blue team event for school with a focus on forensics. I honestly don't know how I was picked, as I am no expert and feel a bit overwhelmed by all this new information. I do, however, feel confident in my network skills, so I guess that's a start.
    

      The tools we will be using are Velociraptor, Arkime, Wazuh, and ElkStack. With access to Wireshark, I am sure.
    

      My main questions are, do you guys and gals use these tools in DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) / Cyber security?
    

      Also, do you still see a future in learning them for someone who is still in school?
    

      And lastly, any recommendations, tips, or tricks for a newbie using these tools? I have had a few weeks of hands-on experience with these tools in a lab, so I got the very basics down pat.
    

      For instance, in Velociraptor, I understand some of the artifacts like .netstat .pslist .users .filefinder .evtx .amcache .prefecth .sam
    

      Along with a few others, I am sure I am forgetting. But are there any built-in artifacts or custom VQL (I take a SQL class next semester, so I am not an expert at VQL) that I should be aware of?
    

      Arkime, I have started to understand the syntax better in the search !=, ==, &&, ||. Using the different tabs, like the second one, to filter and look at Surcata alerts. Any big tips in there?
    

      Wazuh/elk stack, I only briefly used and it looked like a dashboard and a way to visualize the data and hunt but I am less experienced in it compared to the other two.
    

      Thanks!

Hello everyone, I hope you’re all doing well.I’m a future general engineering student who wants to dive deeply into cryptography because of my strong attachment to mathematics.However, I’m a bit confused about the best possible self-learning roadmap.Should I start with theoretical concepts in mathematics (such as combinatorics, arithmetic, and general algebra), coding and algorithmic theory, and programming — or with IT concepts like cybersecurity fundamentals?Also, if you have any information about how someone with a general engineering degree could qualify for a position in cryptography, I would really appreciate your advice.Even the smallest piece of guidance would be highly useful for me. Thank you!
    

      If you know any cryptographers who graduated from generalist schools such as CentraleSupélec or Mines Ponts, I’d be very happy to learn about them.
    

      following a previous post i made about looking for the signal protocol in javascript


      IMPORTANT: My project is not professionally audited or production ready. the signal protocol in my project is entirely redundent. this approach is to investigate encryption redundency in my app.
    

      for my p2p messaging project (a webapp) i wanted to explore an usage of the Signal protocol.... the investigation is still in progress and far from finished. its clear that the Signal protocol is not intended for a p2p architecture with it needing things like pre-keys stored on servers. so it seems nessesary to adapt it.
    

      i looked around for a suitable implementation i could use. compiling the implementation in lib-signal-go to a wasm seemed like an option that worked... but given AI is everywhere, i decided to see if it could put something better together. i started off creating something using browser-based cryptograpy primitives. i would have like to keep it that way, but an ealier AI audit disagreed to using those primitives and so here is an attempt in rust that compiles to wasm.
    

https://github.com/positive-intentions/cryptography/tree/staging/src/rust


      i added several unit tests and and got AI to try create better securty audits, and i think its working well. (or at least well enough). AI's security audit points me to many things i can improve throughout (so i will when i can).
    

      this is fairly complicated stuff and i know better to ask people to spend their own time to review my experimental project... im not sharing for you to review my code; im sharing this here if this is interesting for anyone to take a look.
    

      (note: the repo is getting a bit too "full" and i will be splitting it into a separate repo for just the signal implementation.)
    

      rule 8: im using AI in my project (duh!). the project is big and complicated. im not storing some big document of all the prompts i used.

      Not everything tangentially related to cryptography belongs here.
    

      General cryptocurrency news and other such submissions that do not cover the actual cryptographic algorithms or their implementations are typically not relevant, and thus not allowed here.
    

      Historical information on cryptography is allowed, even old broken ciphers.
    

      This sub's focus is on high quality technical articles and discussions about cryptography.
    

      When applicable, include threat models, verbose accurate descriptions, source code and/or security proofs. Don't leave out important information. Please cite your sources.
    

      We prefer original sources of news, source code, academic papers or similar, rather than clickbaity buzzword blogspam. Avoid snake oil and low quality sources.
    

      Remember that bad advice can be dangerous!
    

      We follow Kerckhoffs' principle, posts that asks for security review of custom algorithms or implementations MUST also publish the full algorithm and a description of its use. Otherwise there can be no meaningful security analysis.
    

      Codes, ciphers, ARGs, and other such "weak crypto" don't belong here. Rule of thumb: If a desktop computer can break a code in less than an hour, it's not strong crypto. Novel challenges based on unusual bugs in modern cryptography algorithms may (or may not) be permitted at the discretion of the moderators.
    

      Simple challenges belongs in r/codes


      Don't use this sub to cheat on competitions, challenges or tests!
    

      We expect people to solve such problems themselves. You may ask for help to understand a problem, but you should disclose the source of the problem if you do.
    

      Note: if you report a submission / comment for violation of this rule, please provide evidence via mod mail, send a PM addressed to r/crypto.
    

      Do not post link shortener or to link farms or similar low quality sites, avoid mirror sites (unless necessary, like archive.org), and link directly to the original (unless you're posting a more readable summary).
    

      Due to the relatively low submission activity in this sub, we generally only allow one or a few visible posts at a time for each particular subject / event / news article, to keep the discussions focused and to avoid flooding the subreddit post stream.
    

      Due to LLMs so often being confidently wrong, we PROHIBIT all undisclosed use of LLM when posting regardless of the nature of your post. If used, you MUST share the prompt!
    

      No LLM / AI is exempt!
    

      If you're here to ask a question, a major problem is that the LLM output will carry implied INCORRECT context which you will not recognize, but which we will see, increasing the risk of misunderstanding. We will not be able to give you correct advice if we don't know your thought process!

Posts must contain software gore.


      This means they display a major error that is obvious to an average user.
    

      Gore is unintentional and only concerns legitimate software.
    

      Problems from user/designer/developer error are not gore.
    

      Posts must contain genuine software gore. Submissions which are faked or misleading will be removed. Violating this rule may result in a ban.
    

      No submissions that have been Done To Death. Many other users found this same error before you and posted it already. Check out our list of common Done To Death submissions.
    

      Titles should be descriptive and/or entertaining. If you're not a funny person or the gore is hard to figure out, use the title to point out the gore.
    

      We have a zero-tolerance policy for mocking the human condition.
    

      NSFW content must be tagged
    

      Do not include personally identifiable information in your posts or comments. This includes, but is not limited to, instagram/twitter handles, full names (like Facebook), phone numbers, email addresses, or addresses.
    

      If you have to scribble on it, you can not post it.
    
Software gore is when software acts outside its parameters and malfunctions unpredictable. Software gore cannot be intentional, and it must not be a fault of the design (crappy design).
Learn more about what is software gore here
What isn't software gore:
Asshole design - deliberately bad software (not software gore)
Crappy design - Issues caused by poor design (not software gore)
Before Posting:
Is the issue here to do with design?
Is the issue intentional?
Does the actual issue tell you what's wrong?
Is the issue caused by something other than software?
If the answer on all those questions is no, congratulations you probably got software gore!

      Posts must be humorous, and they must be humorous because they are programming related. There must be a joke or meme that requires programming knowledge, experience, or practice to be understood or relatable.


See here for further clarification


      Content that is part of top of all time, reached trending in the past 2 months, or has recently been posted, is considered a repost and will be removed
    

      We also remove the following to preserve the quality of the subreddit, even if it passes the previous rules:
    

Feeling/reaction posts


Software errors/bugs that are not code (see r/softwaregore)


Low effort/quality analogies (enforced at moderator discretion)


      Hotlinking is not allowed without explicit permission from the mods, unless it is obvious that the host allows it (e.g. Imgur or other image hosting services).
    

      Rehosting for the purposes of offering a direct link to an image is allowed in the comments.
    

      Any post on the list of common posts will be removed. You can find this list here.
    

      Established meme formats are allowed, as long as the post is compliant with the previous rules.

      Hey everyone 👋
    

I’m working on a project to build Iraq’s first secure, multilingual Electronic Health Record (EHR) system — basically a web platform where doctors, pharmacists, dentists, and nurses can all securely manage and share patient records.
    

      The idea is to replace the current paper-based setup most clinics still use with a proper, centralised digital record that tracks every login, edit, and update (full audit trail).
    

      A full-stack web app with:
    

      Login system for healthcare professionals (unique ID per provider)
    

      Patient registration (auto-generated patient ID)
    

      Patient record page with tabs: problems, meds, labs, imaging, notes, etc.
    

      Internal communication/chat between doctors
    

      Audit logs (every action recorded)
    

      Responsive, modern interface
    

      Multilingual support (English, Arabic, Kurdish, Turkish — I’ll provide translations)
    

Tech stack:React + Tailwind for frontendNode.js or Python for backendPostgreSQL for databaseAWS or Supabase for hosting/storage
    

      My budget is limited — around $2,000 USD total — but I’m open to partnership if you’re interested in joining the project long-term.I’ll handle operations, sales, and business side — you handle tech.
    

      There’s a real opportunity here to scale into clinics and hospitals across Iraq.
    

      All design documents, architecture diagrams, and a React prototype I already have
    

      Freedom to choose backend stack
    

      Credit as founding developer (if you’d like)
    

      Possibility of equity if we build together
    

      Hoping for a working MVP in 8–10 weeks, starting soon.
    

      If you’re a developer who enjoys big-impact projects, even with small budgets, DM me or comment!
    

      Hi guys, I am actively looking for a full stack developer for my startup. The skill set should be of MERN stack specifically along with a good grasp on python. The salary would be competitive.  Anyone interested can DM/comment with your resume/portfolio. Thanks for your attention to this matter.
    

      Hey everyone, I wanted to share a method that many people don't know about, but it can be a great way to make some side income if you need it. It's called bonus arbitrage.
    

      In short, some companies spend so much on customer acquisition that they sometimes make mistakes or overpay, and you can profit from it. You're simply capitalizing on that inefficiency.
    

Here's a great example that takes 5 minutes (or less):


      SoFi (the fintech company) pays platforms $75 to find them a new user who creates an account and makes a deposit, and they only require a $25 deposit to qualify.
    

      So you deposit $25, and they pay you $75. That's all. Takes about 3-4 minutes.
    

Steps:


      Sign up: Gemsloot (this is the platform we use for arbitrage)


      Search "SoFi Invest" and click "start offer"
    

      Create your account, deposit $25
    

      Get your $75 payout within ~24 hours
    

Why does this work? Companies prefer to overpay for a guaranteed conversion rather than waste millions on ads that might not convert. They are throwing money at customer acquisition, and sometimes the math is not in their favor. You can exploit this when you find these rare opportunities.
    

      This isn't a one-off thing, either. There are usually 5-10 live offers like this available at any given time; you just have to know where to look.
    

      ➡️ If you're looking for more arbitrage opportunities, there's a full list here: bonusarb.com

      I'm new to coding, and I've read some posts that are like "just pick one," but my autistic brain wants an actual answer. My goal isn't to use it in a professional setting. I just decided it'd be cool to have coding as a skill. I could use it for small programs or game development. What do you guys recommend based on my situation?
    

      A few weeks ago, i was basically copy-pasting python snippets from tutorials and ai chats.
    

      then i decided to break one apart line by line actually run each piece through chatgpt and cosine CLI to see what failed.
    

      somewhere in the middle of fixing syntax errors and printing random stuff, it clicked. i wasn’t just “following code” anymore i was reading it. it made sense. i could see how one function triggered another.
    

      it wasn’t a huge project or anything, but that moment felt like i went from being a vibecoder to an actual learner.
    

      Was doing some leetcode problems when i encountered some weird behavior i can't make sense of.
    

      Above is the minimalist version to illustrate whats confusing me.
    

      What it should do is fill the heap with tuples of count and value and order them (thus the multiply by minus one.
    

      h_ok works as expected giving but h_wtf gives 
    

      Notice the -2 between -10 and -7In case of a tie heapq should look up the next value inside a tuple.Shouldn't the order of h_wtf be  ?
    

      Hope you guys can understand what im trying to describe.

      Hey everyone,I’m a junior Java developer trying to level up my skills and mindset. I’d really like to hear from experienced Java devs — what’s the one thing (or a few things) you often notice junior developers struggle with or lack?
    

      It could be anything — technical (e.g., understanding of OOP, design patterns, concurrency, Spring Boot internals) or non-technical (e.g., problem-solving approach, debugging skills, code readability, communication, etc.).
    

      I’m genuinely looking to improve, so honest answers are appreciated.Thanks in advance! 🙌

      While job postings are generally not permitted, there are regular monthly "Job Fair" sticky posts where we encourage job postings or people looking for jobs to comment in.
    

      This includes downloads, tools, help, discussions, or anything related to creation, use, or distribution of malicious, piracy-related software, or software designed to violate a service's terms of use or equivalent policies, or the distribution of pirated material. This also includes posting links to pre-compiled binaries or executables of your code as they cannot be validated or trusted to be non-malicious.
    

      Make sure any code is properly formatted, explain what you have tried, and where applicable try to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example. Be clear and courteous. If a question that could have been easily Googled is asked without indicating what and why those typical results didn't work, it will be removed. Help posts that have had little effort put into them will be removed at the discretion of the moderators.
    

      Everyone was novice at some point. Always be courteous in your interactions with others. Just because you feel someone is incorrect/misinformed/misguided does not permit you to be an ass. Being unnecessarily cantankerous or derailing discussions may warrant removal. This rule reaffirms the Reddit site-wide rule of practicing basic Reddiquette. Snidely telling people to use Google, LMGTFY, or AI tools may be removed. Insulting or mocking people for using AI tools may also be removed.
    

      Posting of development tools and libraries are generally allowed. But if the post is basically an advertisement-disguised-as-a-blog, or the post is designed to promote your own product or company, the post will likely be removed. The basic litmus test asks is the post fundamentally made to sell something you're affiliated with, or is it made to benefit the subscribers of r/csharp? In addition, use of affiliate links or referral URLs in submissions is also prohibited.
    

      Blogs, tutorials, videos, or other content must be of passable quality and effort, and not be blogspam or content rehosting. Code snippets indented and readable, writing clear and easy to follow, free of plagiarism, content relatively current (i.e., not terribly obsolete or outdated), no paywalls, sufficient content to be worthwhile to readers. Submissions that are largely AI-generated may be removed. For greater clarity, articles about AI tools/APIs are fine; AI-generated articles are not.
    

      While the use of AI generation tools is not prohibited, when using them you must acknowledge that the code or description or content is AI generated. This empowers readers to scrutinize the result as it may be confidently incorrect, omit critical information, or be out-of-date. It also treads on plagiarism concerns. AI content should not be automatically posted via bots as it should be manually reviewed before posting. Such bots and posts may be removed as spam.
    
      I have a command line app that I what to port to Linux from macOS. It has a few features that use AppKit (NSImage for example) that are not supported on Linux.
    

      Is there a way to custom compile to avoid those features. on Linux but still have them on macOS?  As its only a small part of the application, I'd like not to have to have two separate code bases
    

      For example is there any in-source means to only import AppKit and use NSImage on build on macOS, perhaps with if #available(...)
    

      However, it seems I can't do this at the top-level
    

      Then I was then hoping to use if in functions, but it not working how I wanted for example...
    

      Seems #available(...) is always true on Linux, or I'm doing this wrong
    

      Or, maybe there is a way to leverage the SPM to build with different source files depending on the platform? I'm quite new to SPM and I think I'm struggling to find the right set of words to google for platform dependent building
    

      with xcode 26 trying I am trying to subclass NSMenuItem and I am getting the following errors. The first is:
    

      And the second is for init(coder decoder: NSCoder) which is:

      Hi all,
    

      When working on a Go project that needs to load a large configuration file (dozens or hundreds of settings) on initialization to make the settings available throughout the app, what's the way you'd typically deal with this in Go?
    

      Do you usually define a massive struct with all fields, or is there a another approach for handling large configs like this?
    

      Thanks in advance.
    

      I'm switching from a JS/Python stack to a Golang stack. Today I had my first Golang interview and I don't think I passed. I was very nervous; sometimes I didn't understand a word the interviewer said. But anyway, I think this is a canonical event for anyone switching stacks.
    

      Oh, and one important thing: I studied algorithms/LeetCode with Go, and it was of no use 🤡
    

      At the time, the interviewer wanted to know about goroutines. For a first interview, I thought it would be worse. In the end, I'm happy with the result. I have about 3 more to go. Some points about the interview:
    

      I wasn't asked how a go-routine works.
    

      I was asked how I handle errors within a Go routine (I created a loop where I had 2 channels, 1 with an error, and 1 with success. Here, I had an error because I didn't create a buffered channel.)
    

      I was asked how I handle message ingestion and processing from SQS (it was just an answer about how I would handle it; I commented on the use of the worker pattern).
    

      There were also questions about AWS, Terraform, which event components I had worked with in AWS, and the like.
    

      In short, if it had been in JavaScript, I'm sure I would have passed. But since it was in Go, I don't think I passed. But for those who use Go, only outside of work and have been studying for about 3 months, I think I did well. After the result, I will update here
    

      As a new convert, I still can't stop comparing Go with other languages, the ones I know very well and the ones I don't.
    

      One subject that appears as a recurring theme is something like "yeah, Go could be faster/better/whatever, but it would lose what we all love: the super fast compiler".
    

      That makes me think: why either/or? Can Go not have two compiler modes, say go build -dev and go build -prod? To be honest, I wouldn't mind having an extra coffee break once I'm happy with everything and would appreciate the extra time spent by the compiler on heuristics, optimising away, inlining methods, finding obscure race conditions and what not.

      Post is not in keeping with an inclusive and friendly technical atmosphere.
    

      Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
    

      Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted. Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
    

      Check for your answer in the New to Go? post and the Tour of Go before posting beginner questions, please.
    

      In particular, respect differences of opinion.
    

      Do not include "engagement hooks", like exhortations to subscribe to some channel or redundantly asking what others think.
    

      Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we do disagree, try to understand why.
    

      Avoid derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation. Avoid unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer - or at least solicit - suggestions as to how things may be improved. Avoid snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments) Avoid discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict. Avoid microaggressions Do not post "Ask an AI"
    

      What you say and do matters. Take responsibility for your words and actions, including their consequences, whether intended or otherwise.
    

      As a part of the Go community, this subreddit and those who post on it should follow the tenets laid out in the Go Code of Conduct: https://golang.org/conduct


      Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Be thoughtful in how you communicate. Don’t be destructive or inflammatory.
    

      Posts must be of interest to Go developers and related to the Go language.
    

      This includes:
    

      Articles about the language itself
    

      Announcements & articles about open source Go libraries or applications
    

      Dev tools (open source or not) specifically targeted at Go developers
    

      We ask that you not post about closed-source / paid software that is not specifically aimed at Go developers in particular (as opposed to all developers), even if it is written in Go.
    

      Do not post links to or instructions on how to get pirated copies of copyrighted material.
    

      We have a monthly "Who's Hiring?" post that will stay pinned to the top of the subreddit. To avoid too much noise from companies, please post job openings there. Please keep in mind, this is for 1st party postings only. No 3rd party recruiters.
    

      No GPT or other AI-generated content is allowed as posts, post targets, or comments. This is only for the content itself; posts about GPT or AI related to Go are fine.
    

      Posts of projects have different rules.
    

      As it is not easy to determine what is and is not AI, posts will be removed based on their appearence.
    
      2.13.17 improves compatibility with JDK 25 LTS, supports Scala 3.7, improves Scala 3 compatibility and migration, and more.
    

      It also has a few minor potentially breaking changes.

      I recently came across a superb ebook called "100 Techniques for Writing Readable Rust Code" by Kanro Tomoya. This is an invaluable guide for any Rust developer aiming to write cleaner and more idiomatic code.
    

      The original versions I found were in EPUB and a converted PDF, which can be harder to read and navigate. Additionally, the original formats lack code syntax highlighting, making the Rust examples less clear. To improve the experience, I have converted the ebook into Markdown. Furthermore, I've enhanced it by adding intuitive navigation buttons (Previous, Home, Next) at the end of every chapter for a smoother reading flow.
    

      Heartfelt thanks to Kanro Tomoya for creating this excellent resource and sharing it with the Rust community.

      I made the mistake of buying this book, it looked quite professional and I thought to give it a shot.
    

      After a few chapters, I had the impression that AI certainly helped write the book, but I didn't find any errors. But checking the concurrency and I2C chapters, the book recommends libraries specifically designed for std environments or even linux operating systems.
    

      I've learned my lesson, but let this be a warning for others! Name and shame this author so other potential readers don't get fooled.
    

      Hi Folks! Wanted to share a project I've been working on.
    

Bookokrat is a terminal EPUB reader built in Rust, specifically designed for reading technical books without leaving your terminal.
    

      The core is powered by ratatui, and I've built it for my personal book reading habits
    

      Vim keybindings & mouse support
    

      Image support with Kitty/Sixel/iTerm2 protocols (I've forked ratatui-image to get reasonable performance while scrolling)
    

      Extended HTML rendering support (MathML, tables, lists, sidebars, etc)
    

      Inline annotations, search
    

      Etc
    

      I've read 4 O'Reilly books with it so far and pretty much enjoying distraction free reading experience.

      Disclaimer: 50-60% of the tool is written using Claude Code. But it took quite a bit of polish and re-design to get it to something useful.

I'm just writing since maybe this could provide some insight to someone.Also, maybe could point out what am I doing wrong.


      At work I created a Tool, which for its endeavours uses XML::LibXML.When using it with the latest Strawberry Perl 5.42 I do not have any issues.Everything is working fine.
    

      Some of our colleagues like the snaky language better and do not like the idea of having Perl on their machine or they are just managers and do not have it,but whatever 'different strokes for different folks'.
    

      So I focused my attention on pp, I created a working stonealone executable without any effort.(stonealone: a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine that doesn't have perl installed)
    

      It was working fine on my machine, but one of the colleagues had an issue:Can't load LibXML.xs.dll ...


      After few hours of tinkering, looking through wrong places, experimenting with package creation, sifting through documentation, sifting through the expanded package inside the temp folder, checking .dll-s with EXE/DLL PE Viewer and Editor etc..:
    

      The solution was that I created the package as:
    

pp -o myExecutable.exe myScript.pl -x --xargs=" -g -f 6021485"-l C:\DevEnv\perl\v5_42\c\bin\libxml2-2__.dll-l C:\DevEnv\perl\v5_42\c\bin\zlib1__.dll-l C:\DevEnv\perl\v5_42\c\bin\libiconv-2__.dll-l C:\DevEnv\perl\v5_42\c\bin\liblzma-5__.dll


      As you can see I added the missing .dll-s to the package. Also you can see that I tried to execute the script with -x and also added arguments to execute the script to determine additional dependencies. (but -x did not solve the problem by itself, btw I think it could even be omitted from the call)
    

"Using this option, pp may be able to detect the use of modules that can't be determined by static analysis of inputfile. Examples are stuff loaded by run-time loaders like Module::Runtime or "plugin" loaders like Module::Loader."


      After these everything is fine for users without Perl installed.
    

      Today CPAN turns 30! 🥳
    

      The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) has been online publicly since 1995-10-26, and keeps growing ever since.
    

      According to cpan.org, it
    

      currently has 224,722 Perl modules in 46,095 distributions, written by 14,621 authors, mirrored on 1 servers.

      I've been using nx.dev for a while now, and honestly, it's gone downhill FAST. I've typically used it to manage a full-stack TypeScript project where I have an API of some kind and some front-end that'll use it. I typically use Angular and NestJS because I find those technologies work well for consistency. I usually have a library that has a bunch of interfaces and utility classes that will be used in both back-end and front-end projects. It's super helpful for me to be able to do this.
    

      However, I've found that NX makes this type of pattern so much harder than it has to be. As of writing (Oct 17, 2025,) if you start a brand new Nx monorepo npx create-nx-workspace@latest Select none for the stack so you don't have a monorepo geared towards either a front-end or a back-end, and create your project. If you add nx/angular and nx/nest npm i -D @nx/nest @nx/angular and create an Angular project and a Nest project, neither one will build or run. You'll have errors right away.
    

      You can't even create an Angular project because you get
    

      So to fix that you have to add "declaration": "false" in tsconfig.app.json. Annoying, but fine.
    

      So you go to run your API project and you get
    

      So now you have to go back and remove the "declaration": "false" or set composite to false which will nuke more stuff in the project. It's stupid and this has been an issue starting with NX 19.
    

      I'm also super pissed that they don't allow you to skip their AI question during the creation process. If you don't know they basically force you to choose an AI agent to set up in your project.
    

      I don't want your damn AI slop in my code. I can write code on my own just fine, and I've been doing it for around 20 years.
    

      Seriously, did NX just have some trash AI rewrite their entire codebase and just nobody checked it?

      We get it, you people build awesome things, but this isn't r/sideproject, if you're posting a project it needs to be open source, you need to link to the repo and most importantly given that this is r/typescript it should not only be in typescript but be something that contributes to TS utility (Not just a random lib that happens to be written in TS). Also no general spam of other products or software, even if it's free. Exceptions are at the moderators discretion.
